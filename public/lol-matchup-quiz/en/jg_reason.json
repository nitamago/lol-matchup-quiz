Especially when Zed tries to go all-in, Pantheon's stun is very effective.\n- Zed is vulnerable in team fights, and Pantheon has a global ultimate, giving him influence over other lanes. This allows Pantheon to capitalize when Zed is isolated.\n- Pantheon has the ability to deal burst damage in a short time, increasing the chances of securing kills before Zed can snowball.\n- Zed's cooldown management is crucial, and he has limited means to escape Pantheon's attacks, which puts him at great risk if he makes a mistake.",
