      "ニダリー": "Nidalee is at a disadvantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Jax has strong single-target damage potential after level 6 and excels in prolonged fights, making it dangerous for Nidalee to engage.\n- Nidalee is good at ranged attacks, but if Jax uses his E to negate her auto-attacks, it becomes difficult for her to deal damage.\n- Jax has low base health and defenses, allowing him to gain an advantage over Nidalee, who is highly reliant on items, in early harassment and skirmishes.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- In the early game, actively contest scuttle crabs and avoid skirmishes while being aware of Jax's skill cooldowns.\n- After level 6, when Jax becomes stronger, focus on poking from a distance and managing vision, attacking from the backline in team fights.\n- Build items that enhance mobility and choose magic resistance as a counter to mixed AD, increasing survival rates against Jax.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Jax scales well into the late game and has a high win rate in 1v1 situations, making it difficult for Warwick's early strength to impact the late game.\n- Jax has abilities that enhance his basic attacks, allowing him to negate Warwick's healing, giving him an advantage in trades.\n- Warwick is weak against CC and kiting, making it hard to avoid Jax's attacks, which reduces his impact in team fights.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- In the early game, avoid forcing 1v1s and focus on farming to secure strength in the late game by leveling up.\n- Be cautious of Jax's movements, secure vision, and prioritize dragons and objectives to suppress the enemy's growth.\n- Be creative with item choices, opting for tankier builds to increase durability and improve survival rates in team fights.",
      "ベル＝ヴェス": "Bel'Veth is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Jax is strong in one-on-one duels, and especially in the early game, he can easily deal with Bel'Veth's burst damage, making it likely for Bel'Veth to lose in direct confrontations.\n- Jax's E ability can negate Bel'Veth's attacks, making it difficult for her to deal damage and putting her at a disadvantage in fights.\n- Bel'Veth struggles in early skirmishes and is vulnerable to Jax's early invasions and counter-jungling.\n\nMitigation strategies:\n- Focus on a safe clear at the start, avoid one-on-ones with Jax, and use wards to secure vision.\n- After level 6, aim for resets in skirmishes and play to leverage her strengths in team fights.\n- In team fights, maintain the frontline and avoid tanks to deal with the backline, thereby neutralizing Jax's strengths.",
      "ブライアー": "Briar is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Although Jax is weak in the early game, he has powerful single-target kill potential after level 6 and can withstand Briar's attacks, making her disadvantaged in prolonged fights.\n- Jax's CC skills can likely negate Briar's charges, making her actions restricted during combat.\n- Briar has no ranged attack options, so if she continues to take Jax's normal attacks, she will be at a disadvantage due to sustained damage.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- In the early game, actively roam the jungle to secure vision while avoiding 1v1 encounters with Jax.\n- Before Jax becomes strong, focus on other lanes or objectives to snowball and create an item advantage.\n- In team fights, target other enemy champions instead of Jax, maneuvering to avoid his strength.",
      "ヴァイ": "Vi is at a disadvantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Jax has strong 1v1 potential after level 6, and when he uses his skill to negate Vi's attacks, it becomes difficult for Vi to retaliate.\n- Vi cannot deal damage without getting close, making it hard to avoid Jax's E and leaving her vulnerable to attacks.\n- Jax focuses on farming and scales well into the late game, so Vi's strategy of aiming for early kills is often ineffective.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Actively gank between levels 3-6 to secure kills before Jax can grow stronger.\n- To avoid Jax's E during ganks, position yourself carefully and time your attacks well.\n- Aim for early dragons and secure objectives to apply pressure on Jax.",
      "レク＝サイ": "Rek'Sai is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Jax is weak in the early game, but as time goes on, he can deal powerful damage and has ways to negate Rek'Sai's attacks.\n- Jax relies on his basic attacks and has the ability to negate Rek'Sai's attacks, making Rek'Sai's attacks ineffective.\n- In team fights, if Jax is well-equipped, he can deal high DPS, so even if Rek'Sai tries to ambush, he may end up being countered.\n\nMitigation strategies for the disadvantage:\n- In the early game, focus on safely farming jungle creeps and leveling up instead of forcing trades against Jax.\n- Prioritize ganks in other lanes before Jax becomes strong to create an overall advantage.\n- In team fights, instead of directly targeting Jax, aim for the backline or prioritize attacking other enemy champions.",

      "ヴァイ": "Vi has the advantage.\n\n- Vi has strong 1v1 capabilities, especially against low-health Qiyana. While Qiyana excels at dealing damage quickly, Vi can use her shield and knock-up to deflect Qiyana's attacks and counterattack.\n- Qiyana relies on her ultimate, making it difficult for her to perform well when it's on cooldown or around towers. Vi can take advantage of this gap to catch Qiyana.\n- In team fights, Vi can prioritize targeting carries, effectively mitigating Qiyana's high burst damage. This is especially true when Qiyana is isolated, as Vi's ability to catch her shines.\n\nHow to leverage the advantage:\n- Focus on stable healing in the early game and aim for level 3 before initiating ganks. If Qiyana is closer to her lane, perform an easy gank on the opposite side.\n- Engage in a 1v1 in unfavorable positions for Qiyana (areas without walls or bushes), catching her first to deal instant damage.\n- In team fights, be mindful of positioning and prioritize targeting carries.

      "ダイアナ": "Diana has the advantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Diana has high burst potential at level 6 and the ability to instantly kill isolated enemies, making her a strong counter to Qiyana.\n- Diana has a shield and high sustain, allowing her to withstand Qiyana's burst damage and gain an advantage in one-on-one fights.\n- Qiyana tends to rely on her ultimate, making her less effective during cooldowns or around towers, while Diana has high sustain in team fights and can deal consistent damage.\n\nHow to leverage the advantage:\n- Avoid risky 1v1s before reaching level 6, farm safely using ally pressure, and secure vision.\n- Focus on participating around the dragon to apply pressure as a team, limiting Qiyana's movements.\n- Use narrow spaces and walls to ambush, taking the initiative before Qiyana can use her ultimate to maximize Diana's burst potential.",
