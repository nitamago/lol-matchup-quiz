      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high burst damage, and especially with her W (Riposte), she can negate Yorick's attacks and counterattack. Fiora's Q harassment is also troublesome, as she can gain an advantage in early trades. Additionally, Fiora excels in one-on-one situations, making it difficult for Yorick to counter her high damage and healing capabilities even when he summons his pets. Furthermore, Fiora has an advantage against opponents with delayed crowd control, as she can neutralize Yorick's wall, making fights challenging.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky trades in the early lane and prioritize CS by focusing on minions. Using E or Ghost to bait Fiora's W and attacking after she uses it during crucial engagements can be effective. After level 6, using Maiden to push and applying side pressure can prevent Fiora from participating in team fights. Additionally, purchasing items like Bramble Vest or Executioner's Calling early can help counter her healing and allow for a more favorable long-term fight.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora's W (Riposte) can easily negate Yone's key skills. In particular, Fiora is very strong in 1v1 situations, and by successfully using Riposte, she can nullify Yone's burst damage and gain an advantage in prolonged fights. Additionally, Fiora can heal by hitting vitals, making her strong in sustained damage exchanges. Furthermore, while Fiora is weak in team fights due to her range and area of effect, she can maximize her strengths in 1v1 situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Item selection: It is important to purchase healing reduction (grievous wounds) items early to limit Fiora's healing. Additionally, choosing defensive items can increase durability.\n2. Skill usage: To bait Fiora's W, it is crucial to chip away at her health with Q and predict her Riposte when executing the W→AA combo. Especially, timing the use of R creatively to target moments when Fiora's W is on cooldown can be beneficial.\n3. Lane positioning: In the early game, it is effective to sustain through minions while using E to disengage or feint, avoiding direct contact with Fiora. By applying wave pressure and forcing Fiora to use her Riposte, you can create opportunities for your next attack.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high burst damage and possesses a powerful parry (W) especially in one-on-one combat. The damage from Fiora's ultimate (R) is also a threat, and after level 6, there is a possibility of being taken down quickly. Additionally, Fiora can deal damage while healing by hitting her vitals, making it difficult to engage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Fiora has an advantage against opponents with delayed crowd control, and Mundo's passive, which negates hard CC, may not be very effective in this matchup.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid direct confrontations during the laning phase and utilize sustain under the minions. Use Q to bait Fiora's W and position yourself to avoid her vitals. After level 6, it is effective to engage in short trades when Fiora's W or R is on cooldown. Additionally, strengthening coordination with the jungle and attacking when Fiora lacks her skills can help alleviate her strengths. In terms of items, prioritizing durability items after Doran's Shield and aiming for a prolonged fight can provide a chance for victory.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high 1v1 decisiveness, especially by using her W (Parry) to negate Singed's CC and damage, allowing her to counterattack. Fiora's burst damage and healing capabilities are very effective against Singed's sustained damage. Additionally, Fiora has strong percentage damage against tanks and juggernauts, which allows her to have an advantage against tank champions like Singed. Furthermore, Singed lacks ranged attack options, so if Fiora is allowed to close the distance, the risk of being attacked unilaterally increases.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, between levels 1 and 3, avoid unnecessary trades and prioritize lane management by proxy farming while taking damage from minions with Q. It is important to use W (Fling) after Fiora has used her W to bait it out. Also, when Fiora's W is down, either chase with E→Q or alternatively, maintain distance and regroup with allies. After level 6, prioritize being a tank or disruptor in team fights and avoid solo encounters to make the most of Singed's strengths.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora's parry can easily negate Irelia's important skill, W. Fiora excels in sustained 1v1 fights and can gain significant healing by hitting her vitals, making it easy for her to counterattack even if Irelia tries to go for a short burst. Additionally, Fiora can easily engage against Irelia, who lacks crowd control, and since Irelia's escape potential is limited, she becomes vulnerable to Fiora's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, use minions to maintain health with Q and maneuver to avoid Fiora's attacks.\n2. Save Fiora's W and engage after provoking her important skill.\n3. Engage in short trades and recall before Fiora can counterattack to avoid prolonged fights.\n4. After level 6, utilize R to split Fiora and create advantageous situations by aiming for isolation in side lanes while being cautious of ganks.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora is extremely strong as a duelist, especially in one-on-one situations. Fiora's W (Riposte) can negate Pantheon's E (Shield Vault), giving her a chance to counterattack, which makes it risky for Pantheon to go all-in. Additionally, Fiora has strong percentage damage against tanks, which means she can deal damage before Pantheon can scale. Furthermore, Fiora has high split-pushing ability, often pushing the lane while Pantheon attempts to roam.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to buy a Bramble Vest early to hinder Fiora's healing. Next, to avoid Fiora's W, it is effective to engage in trades after forcing her to use it. Additionally, pushing the minions towards the enemy tower and roaming can help regain control against Fiora by applying pressure in other lanes. Finally, in team fights, it is crucial to coordinate with allies' crowd control to relatively diminish Fiora's strength.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Fiora's strong counter abilities and high mobility. Fiora can use her W (Riposte) to negate Aatrox's skills and even apply a stun. As a result, Aatrox must be very cautious when trying to engage Fiora. Additionally, Fiora has high instant mobility, making it easier for her to dodge Aatrox's skills, which reduces Aatrox's opportunities to deal damage. Furthermore, Fiora has powerful percentage damage against tank champions, making her effective at whittling down Aatrox's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, be aware of Fiora's W (Riposte) cooldown and time your attacks for after it has been used. Additionally, using your E to dodge Fiora's attacks can be effective. Furthermore, purchasing Steelcaps can reduce damage from Fiora's basic attacks and increase your durability. Finally, consider using Teleport to continue farming without leaving the lane and coordinate with teammates to counter Fiora when necessary.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has strong dueling capabilities and can deal effective percentage damage, especially against tanks like Cho'Gath. Fiora can negate Cho'Gath's crowd control with her W and has a high ability to counterattack, making Cho'Gath unfavorable in close combat. Additionally, Fiora has a low cooldown leap skill, allowing her to quickly close the distance, often creating advantageous situations before Cho'Gath can initiate an attack. Furthermore, Cho'Gath lacks AoE attacks, making his wave clear slow and allowing Fiora to easily gain lane control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, Cho'Gath should avoid forcing close combat in the early lane phase and instead use his E to poke from a distance, charging his Q behind minions to aim for a landing. Additionally, using his W to suppress Fiora's healing and auto-attacks can diminish her strengths. Prioritizing minion management and avoiding unnecessary trades with Fiora is key to increasing survival rates in lane. Furthermore, building items to enhance durability will allow Cho'Gath to better withstand Fiora's engages in coordination with allies.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora specializes in 1v1 split kills and can counterattack by parrying Ornn's CC. Fiora's W (Parry) nullifies Ornn's E and R, granting her a stun, which puts Ornn at a disadvantage in trades. Additionally, Fiora has strong percentage damage against tanks, making it easier to chip away at Ornn's durability. Furthermore, Ornn's low mobility makes it difficult for him to deal with Fiora's leap skills, which is another disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Minion Management**: Properly manage minions to avoid situations where Fiora can easily target her Vital, and avoid trading with her.\n2. **Safe Farming**: Ornn should poke with Q while keeping his distance to avoid Fiora's attacks. Specifically, attack only after confirming the cooldown of Fiora's W.\n3. **Team Coordination**: After level 6, use R to coordinate with teammates and fulfill his role in team fights. If Fiora can be isolated, Ornn can leverage his strengths.\n4. **Item Selection**: Purchase defensive items early to reduce Fiora's damage and increase durability.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has very high single-target damage, especially with her powerful percentage damage in 1v1 situations. Fiora's ultimate increases her damage, so in encounters where items are fully built, Gwen often finds herself at a disadvantage. Additionally, Fiora is favored against opponents with delayed crowd control, and Gwen's slow effect cannot sufficiently restrain Fiora's mobility. Furthermore, Gwen has a short range, making it difficult to avoid Fiora's attacks, especially after level 6 when it becomes harder to counter Fiora.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to first purchase Bramble Vest and Ninja Tabi. This will reduce Fiora's damage and enhance Gwen's survivability in prolonged fights. Also, when Fiora's vitals are facing Gwen, she can reduce Fiora's damage by resetting out of sight. Moreover, after using her ultimate, standing near a wall can make it difficult for Fiora to activate all her vitals, allowing Gwen to gain an advantage in fights. In team fights, it is also crucial to leverage Gwen's strengths and avoid 1v1 encounters with Fiora.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high damage and is particularly strong in one-on-one combat. By using Fiora's W (Parry), she can negate Sion's CC (knock-ups and slows) and counterattack. Additionally, Fiora excels at short-term trades by targeting vitals, making it easier to chip away at Sion's HP. Furthermore, Sion lacks AoE attacks, making it difficult to counter Fiora's wave clear ability, which increases the likelihood of being pushed in lane.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Avoid harassment in lane and play conservatively to bait Fiora's W.\n2. Use minions to dodge Fiora's attacks while chipping away from a distance with Q (Charge) and E.\n3. Engage after Fiora has used her W to reduce the risk of counterattacks.\n4. Build tank items early to increase durability and better absorb Fiora's damage.\n5. Coordinate with the jungler to aim for ganks, applying pressure on Fiora to regain lane control.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has percentage damage and true damage, which is particularly effective against tanks like K'Sante. Fiora's W (Riposte) can negate K'Sante's CC while also applying a stun, making it easy to parry K'Sante's attacks. Additionally, Fiora excels in one-on-one situations and can exploit K'Sante's vulnerability when he is in his all-out state, making it easier to deal damage. Furthermore, Fiora has strong split-pushing capabilities, making it difficult for K'Sante to maintain lane control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the most effective strategy is to ban Fiora. If facing her, it is important to be cautious of Fiora's W and to conserve skills when engaging. Utilizing walls to force Fiora's vitals can help turn the fight in your favor. In terms of itemization, purchasing items like Stoneplate, Fimbulwinter, and Sterak's can enhance durability. During team fights, when Fiora uses her ultimate, escaping in the opposite direction can reduce her vitals. Finally, in the laning phase, it is crucial to focus on gaining a minion advantage and to play safely to avoid contact with Fiora.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora is extremely strong in one-on-one combat, especially since she can parry Braum's CC (W) to counterattack. Fiora's passive healing and bonus damage give her an advantage in trades against Braum. Additionally, Fiora has high split-pushing capabilities and is at an advantage against champions with long-range attacks, making it difficult for Braum to approach. Furthermore, Braum's main skills have short range, making it hard to counter Fiora's mobility.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it's important to engage in short trades to bait Fiora's W and then disengage quickly. Additionally, being aware of the positioning of Fiora's vitals and maneuvering to avoid attacks is crucial. After level 6, when using the ultimate to chase, it's wise to be cautious of Fiora's parry while looking for ambush opportunities from the side bushes. Moreover, utilizing ally ganks and disrupting in team fights can help to diminish Fiora's strength relatively.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has strong 1v1 capabilities and can gain an advantage over melee champions like Garen. Fiora's W grants her invulnerability, which negates Garen's Q and E attacks, while also providing her with opportunities to counterattack. Additionally, Fiora can deal extra damage and heal by hitting her vitals, allowing her to withstand Garen's sustained damage. Furthermore, Fiora excels at split-pushing and tower destruction, making it difficult for Garen if she gains lane control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Item build adjustments: Purchase items like Dead Man's Plate or Steelcaps early to reduce Fiora's damage.\n2. Rune selection: Choosing Phase Rush can help avoid contact with Fiora. If you're not confident, opting for Conqueror is also a good choice.\n3. Using Q: Instead of running straight at Fiora, click around to trigger her W, increasing your chances of counterattacking.\n4. Using E: When Fiora uses her ultimate, position yourself near a wall to prevent her from hitting her weak points.\n5. In lane, avoid using Q until Fiora uses her W to prevent trades. It's important to refrain from counterattacking when she pokes you.\n6. Clear the second or third wave to create opportunities for jungle support and potential ganks.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can mitigate the disadvantage in the matchup against Fiora and fight more favorably.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has strong 1v1 capabilities and can gain an advantage over Kail, especially between levels 1 and 10. Fiora's skills deal high damage, and her attacks after using Q and E are particularly powerful. Additionally, Fiora's invulnerability from her W can negate Kail's attacks and provide an opportunity for counterattacks. Furthermore, Fiora can deal significant percentage damage to tank champions, making Kail's hybrid damage less effective. In the early game, Kail is very weak, and she continues to be at a disadvantage against Fiora until she reaches level 6, making it difficult to approach and insufficient to retaliate against harassment.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid mistakes between levels 1 and 10. It is important to identify opportunities to attack after Fiora uses her Q or E and to dodge her W. After level 6, prioritizing farming and avoiding contact with Fiora can help in gaining strength. Additionally, selecting the Fleet Footwork rune can ensure sustain, increasing survival rates in lane. In terms of item build, it is important to stack items that help survive the early game. It can also be effective to fight while backing away with your back to a wall to avoid Fiora's all-in.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora can parry Yasuo's knock-up with her W, making it easy for her to counterattack, especially when Yasuo tries to engage. Additionally, Fiora has healing from her passive and high damage, allowing her to gain an advantage in one-on-one combat. Furthermore, Fiora excels at short engagements, making it difficult for Yasuo to deal with her split-pushing capabilities even if he prefers prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Timing Management of W**: Be cautious when engaging to provoke Fiora's W, and attack when her W is on cooldown.\n2. **Utilizing Minions**: Use minions to position yourself, avoiding Fiora's attacks while dealing damage with Q.\n3. **Jungle Intervention**: After level 6, seek support from the jungle to avoid one-on-one situations with Fiora or to gain an advantage.\n4. **Item Selection**: Purchase defensive items early to reduce Fiora's damage and increase your durability."

    "loses": {
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Fiora is powerful in short-term one-on-one duels, Anbessa has dashes attached to all of his skills, allowing him to utilize high mobility to evade Fiora's attacks. Additionally, by timing his R to negate Fiora's W, he can prevent her counterattacks and create opportunities for a comeback. Furthermore, Anbessa has ranged attack options, enabling him to deal damage before Fiora can close the distance.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to prioritize minion farming in the early game to build up passive. Use Q and E from a position where Fiora's W won't hit, and follow up with E's slow to chase her when she leaps. After level 6, aim to attack with R when Fiora's W is down, using suppression to deal damage. Also, when a vital appears due to taking damage from Fiora, it's crucial to maintain distance and avoid unnecessary solo fights. By coordinating with allies and timing attacks when Fiora's W is down, you can seize the opportunity for victory.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in lane. In particular, he can deal significant damage to Fiora with combos using his barrels (E). Additionally, he can cleanse crowd control and heal with his W, making it easier to mitigate Fiora's attacks. Furthermore, Gangplank has an infinite range ultimate (R) after level 6, allowing for easy support to other lanes.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to harass Fiora from level 1 and apply pressure. When Fiora hides in the bushes to go for a last hit, Gangplank can retaliate with his Q and reduce damage by slowing her attack speed with W. Also, purchasing Ninja Tabi early and completing one item allows him to deal true damage to Fiora. He should play safely until level 6, blocking Fiora's attacks, and after acquiring Trinity Force, he can engage Fiora favorably. A smart player should also prioritize controlling the lane rather than forcing fights.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has strong engage capabilities against Fiora, especially being able to negate Fiora's W (Riposte). While Fiora excels in 1v1 combat, Malphite can increase his durability by stacking armor, reducing Fiora's damage. Additionally, Malphite's E (Seismic Shard) can lower Fiora's attack speed, hindering her healing abilities.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to choose Aftershock as your rune and prioritize building armor items (like Bramble Vest or Thornmail) early on. In the early laning phase, use Q (Rock Throw) to poke from a distance and aim to force Fiora to use her W. When her W is down, use E followed by R (Unstoppable Force) to engage and trade favorably against Fiora. Also, coordinate with the jungle to target Fiora's W cooldown, and in team fights, use R to disable multiple enemies, contributing to the overall success of the team.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble can continuously harass Fiora, especially by using Q and E to chip away at her health. While Fiora can deal powerful damage in close combat, Rumble can avoid her attacks and deal damage by effectively using his skills. Additionally, Rumble's ultimate provides sustained damage and slows to enemies within its range, making it easier to limit Fiora's engage and prevent her counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to start by hiding behind minions and harassing with Q and E, provoking Fiora's W (Riposte). After forcing her to use W, engaging in short trades becomes easier to deal damage to Fiora. After level 6, utilizing the ultimate to zone Fiora will reduce the risk of taking her attacks while aiming to contribute in team fights. Moreover, maneuvering to prevent Fiora from hitting multiple vitals and avoiding prolonged 1v1s will be key to victory.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille can dominate Fiora by utilizing her wall-slam E and R. By effectively reading Fiora's W (Parry) and conserving it, Camille can negate Fiora's CC while launching her own attacks. Additionally, Camille has a shield from her passive, giving her high durability in short trades. Furthermore, Camille's percentage damage and true damage are effective against tanky Fiora.\n\nTo take advantage, first, use wards to secure vision and position yourself in a way that makes it easier to land wall E. Once you see Fiora's W, conserve your E, force her to use W, and then engage. Engage in short trades, aim for wall slams with E, and isolate Fiora with R to attempt a quick kill. If Fiora has significant healing, it's important to purchase Bramble Vest early and choose Black Cleaver and Sterak's as core items to ensure durability while increasing damage.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus is an extremely powerful champion in the late game, and his damage scales infinitely by stacking his Q. While Fiora has high kill pressure in the early game, Nasus can reduce Fiora's attack speed with his W (Wither), which helps mitigate the difference in auto-attacks. Additionally, Nasus has high sustain from his passive and excels at maintaining his lane, making it easier for him to withstand Fiora's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to safely farm CS with Q in the early game while avoiding Fiora's attacks. Equipping a Doran's Shield or Bramble Vest to increase durability and baiting Fiora's W before counterattacking can allow for favorable short trades. After level 6, using his ultimate to increase durability and dragging the fight into the long term can help counter Fiora. In the mid-game, stacking Q under the tower while leveraging his resilience in team fights can contribute to the team effectively.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has strong HP regeneration and powerful critical attacks utilizing Fury, which allows for sustained combat ability, especially in one-on-one situations. Additionally, with his ultimate, he becomes invulnerable for 5 seconds, enabling him to negate Fiora's attacks while counterattacking. By successfully avoiding Fiora's W (Riposte), Tremendous can deal damage more easily.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on farming CS in the early lane phase and use Q to build Fury and heal. It's important to time your attacks when Fiora's W is on cooldown, closing the distance with E to engage. Particularly, initiating an all-in right after Fiora uses her W makes it easier for Tremendous to land his full combo. Furthermore, in team fights or split fights, leveraging Tremendous's split-pushing ability and choosing to engage Fiora in a 1v1 can help maintain an advantageous position.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar can grow stronger by stacking his Q (Siphon Strike), allowing him to deal powerful damage in the late game. In the early game, he is at a disadvantage against Fiora, but by choosing items that increase his durability, Gnar can better withstand Fiora's attacks. Additionally, Gnar's W (Whittle) can limit Fiora's blink and attacks, making it particularly effective when Fiora tries to go all-in. Furthermore, Gnar can utilize the CC effects of his Mega Gnar form to excel in team fights, allowing him to maintain an advantageous position throughout the match.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (levels 1-3), since Fiora is strong, it is important for Gnar to safely farm CS without forcing fights. He should use minions to gain Q stacks and appropriately use W to avoid Fiora's attacks. In the mid-game (levels 3-6), it is advisable to look for opportunities to force Fiora to use her W, then slow her down with Gnar's W and wait for jungle intervention. After level 6, Gnar can use his R to secure durability while stacking Q, increasing his ability to counter Fiora. After Fiora uses her W, looking for a chance to retaliate with Gnar's W can be a key point that determines the outcome of the match.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has a high counter ability in 1v1 against Fiora, especially by successfully baiting Fiora's W (Riposte), which allows him to negate Fiora's attacks while gaining a chance to counterattack. Additionally, Warwick can use his E (Jaws of the Beast) to reduce incoming damage, making it easier for him to endure Fiora's attacks in sustained combat.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to focus on safely farming CS in the early game and to avoid 1v1 encounters with Fiora. While conserving Fiora's W, Warwick can use his E to take damage and bait Fiora's W. After Fiora's W is used, he can close the gap with his Q and initiate an attack with his R, creating a favorable situation against Fiora. Furthermore, by being aware of Fiora's vitals and engaging in short trades, Warwick can continuously deal damage while utilizing his healing effects.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has poke from a distance and a ranged stun, which can deter Fiora's approach. Fiora is strong in close combat, but by using Kennen's skills to maintain distance while attacking, you can deal damage before Fiora gets close. Additionally, by applying a mark with Kennen's W and using E to create distance, you can avoid Fiora's all-in and save Kennen's powerful R for team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, start by gradually poking with Q to gain experience without forcing an approach. Next, use short E or Q to trigger Fiora's W and gauge her reaction. After Fiora's W is used, approach with E and stack marks with W→AA to deal damage. To avoid Fiora's all-in, if she has her repost available, avoid prolonged fights and save R for team fights. Finally, it's important to keep the minion wave in your favor and maintain a position where Fiora cannot hit her vitals near walls or under towers.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has short-term burst damage and crowd control, which can disrupt Fiora's dash. By utilizing Riven's skills, it is possible to deal damage without allowing Fiora to take advantage of her passive and healing. Additionally, Riven can push the lane quickly and use minions to fight while being aware of Fiora's vitals.\n\nTo gain the advantage, start by using E to close the distance and Q for small poke from level 1 to 2. During this time, it is important to save W while predicting Fiora's empowered attack. From levels 3 to 6, deal chip damage with a short combo (E→Q→W→Q→AA) before using R, and avoid using W when Fiora uses her W. After level 6, evade Fiora's R dash with E in the opposite direction and aim for a burst with a combo. When going for a kill, it is effective to target the window when Fiora's parry is down.\n\nAlso, be mindful of minion management, as Riven can struggle in 1v1 situations against minions, so try not to push the lane too much. For item selection, choose Brutalizer or Black Cleaver, and then aim for a Gunblade. It is advisable to select tanky boots. In side lanes or team fights, it is crucial to spot Fiora first, coordinate with teammates to lock her down, and eliminate her immediately.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius excels in long trades against Fiora and can utilize his sustained damage from bleeding. While Fiora has strength in one-on-one situations, Darius can deal damage before Fiora can retaliate by leveraging his passive damage and his ability to close the gap with E. Additionally, by being mindful of Fiora's W (Riposte) while attacking, Darius can bait out the W and then engage after it has been used, avoiding Fiora's counterattack.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to manage minions in the early lane phase and provoke jungle ganks. At levels 2-3, use Q and auto-attacks to stack bleeding while being cautious of Fiora's W, avoiding consecutive uses of E or Q. After baiting out her W, approach with E and aim for 5 stacks to secure a kill with R effectively. For items, choosing tank elements like Black Cleaver and Sterak's allows Darius to leverage his strengths in prolonged fights.",
      "セト": "Set has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Set has a high ability to deal sustained damage against Fiora, especially in long trades. By utilizing Set's passive for HP recovery and shields, he can deflect Fiora's attacks while counterattacking. Additionally, using Set's E to close the gap to Fiora allows him to deal damage with auto-attacks and Q, making it possible to avoid Fiora's parry.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be aware of Fiora's passive and to reset the lane if the mark is in front of her. Use Set's E to approach Fiora and time your auto-attacks and Q carefully. It's also effective to go all-in when Fiora uses her W. Starting with Blade of the Ruined King (BoTRK) as your first item and then purchasing Stridebreaker prioritizes your damage and creates a favorable situation against Fiora. After Fiora uses Flash, there will be an opportunity to attack when you engage again, so be sure not to miss that timing.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has the ability to deal sustained damage to Fiora, and by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W, he can easily avoid Fiora's attacks. Additionally, since Fiora's attacks are primarily melee, Bloodmire can use his range to harass her. Furthermore, since Fiora's crowd control is limited to her W, Bloodmire can time his counterattacks effectively.\n\nTo gain the advantage, from levels 1 to 3, he should be cautious of Fiora's high damage while using Q to clear minions and heal himself. After level 6, he can use R to deflect Fiora's attacks and look for opportunities to counterattack. In terms of item build, purchasing \"Rune Echo\" and \"Zhonya's Hourglass\" early will increase his durability and reduce Fiora's damage. In team fights, it is crucial to target Fiora when she is isolated and coordinate with allies to deal damage."

  "リヴェン": {
    "name": "リヴェン",
    "beats": {
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Riven's powerful crowd control (stun) and high burst damage. Riven has many skills that involve movement, making it easier to engage in favorable trades against Yasuo, especially after using E or W. Additionally, all of Riven's skills are melee attacks, and Yasuo's Wind Wall (W) cannot block Riven's attacks, making it very troublesome when Riven gets close. Furthermore, Riven can push the lane quickly, making it difficult for Yasuo to farm CS, which is another disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force trades in the early game and to farm CS from a distance using Q. It is effective to look for short-term counterattacks after forcing Riven to use her skill cooldowns. Also, when reaching level 6, it is crucial to aim for the Tornado (Q charge) and create opportunities to attack while avoiding Riven's skills. Proper wave management is essential, and if pushed by the opponent, make sure to safely farm CS under the tower. Summoners should primarily take Flash and TP, and if the opponent is all-in, considering Exhaust can also be a good option.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Riven's high burst damage and mobility. Riven can deal significant damage in a short amount of time by chaining her skills, and especially at levels 2-3, if she targets a full combo, Mundo has no room to counterattack. Additionally, Riven's W (stun) restricts Mundo's movement, making it difficult for him to utilize his passive effectively. Furthermore, Riven has an advantage in being able to easily approach Mundo, who is weak against immobilizing crowd control, by using her skills.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the early lane phase, it is important to safely farm CS behind the minions and avoid Riven's skills. Timing a counterattack after Riven has used her skills is effective, and harassing with Q can be beneficial. As for items, prioritizing armor items (such as Bramble Vest or Plate) early on will increase durability and reduce Riven's damage. After level 6, utilizing R to endure damage and playing the tank role in team fights to withstand Riven's burst is the goal.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has short-term burst damage and crowd control, and can deal powerful damage especially between levels 1 and 5. Riven can attack while spamming her Q and use her E to engage in close combat effectively. Additionally, Riven's W stun limits Yone's movement and becomes a factor that puts him at a disadvantage in damage trades. Yone is highly item-dependent and struggles to counter Riven until he gets his items. Furthermore, Riven's all-in after using her skills is very strong, making it difficult for Yone to time his engagement.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS and avoid unnecessary attacks between levels 1 and 3 to dodge Riven's Q spam. After Riven uses her skills, Yone can perform a short QAA and quickly create distance to minimize damage. It is also effective to look for the right timing to all-in after Riven has used her E and W, attacking while her skills are on cooldown. Until Yone's items are ready, he should play cautiously, avoiding Riven's attacks while using sustain and bushes to create advantageous situations.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nRiven has high burst damage and plenty of mobility, allowing her to maximize her attacks, especially by chaining her skills. Riven's Q deals significant damage, and she can use her W, which has a stun, to gain an advantage in damage trades. Additionally, Riven can easily engage and all-in against Mordekaiser, who is weak to immobilizing crowd control. Furthermore, Riven can harass Mordekaiser from a distance, who is vulnerable to harassment in lane, allowing her to establish an early advantage.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to be strategic in the early game. It is recommended to give up the first three minions and avoid Riven's attacks. Taking Bone Plating can help prevent Riven's all-ins, and purchasing Steelcaps or a Giant's Belt on the first back can effectively prevent being one-shot. After level 6, using R can help counter Riven and create opportunities to gain an advantage in one-on-one situations. In terms of item build, prioritizing a tank build and choosing items like Sunfire and Ninja Tabi is crucial for increasing durability. By avoiding Riven's Q and conserving W to prepare for an all-in, you can find opportunities to turn the tide.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reasons why she is at a disadvantage against Riven are as follows. First, Riven has high burst damage and can incapacitate Gwen with her CC skill, stun. Riven's Q is very powerful and can deal continuous damage, making it easy for Gwen to be overwhelmed in trades. Additionally, Riven has abundant mobility, allowing her to easily dodge Gwen's attacks and create advantageous situations for herself. Furthermore, Gwen has a short range and often finds herself in situations where she is vulnerable to Riven's attacks, especially when Riven is strong, as a single mistake can be fatal.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is recommended to take Exhaust. This will reduce Riven's burst damage and increase survival rates in trades. It is also important to gain an advantage at level 1, focusing on short trades and avoiding Riven's Q. Proper wave management is crucial, and when Riven is strong, playing cautiously and waiting for the opponent's mistakes is necessary. By being wary of Riven's engage and backing off during trades, you can reduce risks.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has high burst damage from the early game and excels at short trades. Riven can use the E+Q combo to attack while disrupting Bloodmire's Q casting and healing. Additionally, Riven has mobility skills, making it easier to dodge Bloodmire's abilities, and can overwhelm Bloodmire with burst damage, especially after level 6. Furthermore, Bloodmire has long cooldowns and low DPS in the early game, making it easy for Riven to take control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky trades in the early game and focus on maintaining CS. Positioning to avoid Riven's attacks and placing extra wards for gank prevention is also crucial. After level 6, utilizing the invulnerability effect of W to dodge Riven's burst and looking for counterattack opportunities is effective. Additionally, in item selection, prioritize health and ability power, and aim to gather Reliant or Liandry's items early to increase durability while dealing damage.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Riven's burst damage and continuous crowd control. Riven can deal high burst damage by using her skills in succession, and especially after level 6, there is a risk of being taken down quickly with a full combo (W+Q+E+R). Additionally, if Anbessa is hit by Riven's immobilizing crowd control, he loses the opportunity to counterattack, making it difficult to deal damage. Furthermore, Riven has abundant AoE damage and can push the lane quickly, making it hard for Anbessa to control the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid directly engaging Riven in the early game and focus on securing CS while building up passive. Using E to farm minions and utilizing slows to maintain distance is effective for avoiding Riven's skills. Additionally, placing W in time with Riven's dash can create opportunities for counterattacks by taking advantage of increased damage taken. Moreover, choosing sustain and toughness items (like Black Cleaver and Sterak's) can help reduce damage taken and favor a prolonged fight. Receiving support from the jungle is also crucial to suppress Riven's burst damage.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven's high burst damage and abundant blink and crowd control skills make it difficult for Set to approach. Riven can maximize her damage by using her skills in succession, and her strength becomes particularly prominent after level 4. Additionally, Set is vulnerable to Riven's immobilizing crowd control, and when Riven uses her stun, Set is left unable to do anything. Furthermore, Riven can easily harass Set in lane, who is weak against ranged harassment, making it difficult for Set to avoid trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid trading with Riven and to focus on wave management. You can apply pressure on Riven by aiming for jungle ganks. Additionally, since you can initiate attacks before reaching level 4, taking advantage of that timing is also effective. Choosing runes that provide damage shields or double armor runes, and acquiring Stridebreaker or Gore early can help reduce Riven's damage. During trades, it is crucial to use E to avoid Riven's stun and then look for the right moment to counterattack with W. Finally, selecting other champions (e.g., Shen) can also be a strategy to aim for a more favorable matchup against Riven.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Riven's high burst damage and mobility. Riven can quickly close the gap using her skills and deal significant damage to Kail with her combos. Additionally, Riven's skill that has a stun restricts Kail's movement, making it easier for her to miss opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, Kail is very weak in the early game and often finds herself at a disadvantage against Riven until she reaches level 6.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. It's important to be aware of spacing and maintain distance from Riven. By avoiding Riven's E, you can reduce the risk of being hit by stuns or combos.\n2. In terms of rune selection, choosing Fleet Footwork instead of Predator allows for sustained healing.\n3. When Riven dashes towards you, try to use E to escape and avoid her attacks.\n4. In your item build, prioritize farming safely without forcing pokes until you have Nashor's, mythic items, and Bloodthirster.\n5. Purchase boots early to increase your movement speed, making it easier to dodge Riven's attacks.\n6. Be mindful of CS management, especially protecting cannon minions. Maintaining a freeze and preventing Riven from freezing the lane can also be effective.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can mitigate the disadvantage in the matchup against Riven and fight more favorably.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Riven's high burst damage and mobility. Riven can deal significant damage in a short amount of time by utilizing her skills, and especially with her combos, she can quickly whittle down Braum's HP. Additionally, Riven can evade attacks with her E's blink and use her CC skills with stuns to neutralize Braum's attacks, making it difficult for Braum to approach Riven. Furthermore, Braum's main skills have short range, making him vulnerable to Riven's harassment from a distance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. In the early lane phase, focus on minion management and aim for short trades to avoid Riven's combos. Look for opportunities to attack after Riven has used her skills.\n2. After level 3, be mindful of auto-attack exchanges and chip away at Riven with Q→AA. The moment after Riven uses her E is the time to engage, so don't miss that opportunity.\n3. Save Flash and key CC abilities to counterattack the moment Riven approaches. Especially when Riven misses her skills, be aggressive in your response.\n4. In team fights, step forward to disrupt the enemy carry, and if caught by Riven, coordinate with teammates to focus her down, thereby reducing Riven's impact.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Braum can mitigate his disadvantage in the matchup against Riven and create a more favorable situation.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has high mobility and damage, making her adept at dodging Ornn's skills and engaging with her stun. Riven's dashes are very effective against Ornn's abilities, especially when she attacks after dashing more than twice, making it difficult for Ornn to retaliate. Additionally, Riven has strong lane dominance and can create advantageous situations early on, which puts Ornn under pressure in the lane.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to push the lane and freeze it near the tower. This makes it harder to take damage from Riven. Next, purchasing armor every 300 gold will increase durability, allowing Ornn to withstand Riven's damage. It is also effective to activate Aftershock when Riven goes for a cannon and time the engagement accordingly. Furthermore, Riven's third Q is predictable, so if you can save your W to avoid the knock-up, it becomes easier to negate Riven's attacks. Finally, when the jungler is absent, it is crucial not to force fights, farm under the tower, and aim for the late game.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has high burst damage and can quickly attack using her skills. In particular, by taking advantage of Riven's Q cooldown to attack, Sion is likely to be at a disadvantage in damage trades. Additionally, it is difficult to prevent Riven from utilizing her mobility, and if Sion gets caught by CC before closing the gap, he becomes unable to do anything. Furthermore, Riven is an auto-attack-based skirmisher and has elements that allow her to fight favorably against tanks like Sion.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Playstyle**: It is important to play carefully to avoid allowing Riven to use her Q. Specifically, look for opportunities to attack after Riven has used her Q and is on cooldown.\n\n2. **Lane Management**: Freezing the minion wave near your tower can create a situation where Riven has difficulty collecting CS, thereby stunting her growth.\n\n3. **Item Build**: Prioritizing tank items is crucial to reduce Riven's damage. Choosing items like Ninja Tabi or Frozen Heart can enhance your durability.\n\n4. **Focus on Late Game**: Since Sion is a late-game champion, it is important not to force a win in lane but to safely farm and prioritize your role in team fights.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Riven's high burst damage and mobility. Riven can use short combos to apply pressure from level 2 to 3, making it difficult for Fiora to farm in the early game. Additionally, Riven can utilize her stun (W) and mobility skill (E) to dodge Fiora's attacks or initiate her own. Furthermore, Riven can maximize her damage by chaining her skills, making it easier for her to exploit the openings after Fiora uses Riposte (W).\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize minion farming in the early game without forcing engagements and to avoid Riven's combos. By reading Riven's skills and using Riposte appropriately, Fiora can block incoming attacks while looking for counterattack opportunities. Also, being cautious of ganks and securing vision will allow Fiora to farm safely. In the mid to late game, leveraging Fiora's split-pushing ability while avoiding 1v1s with Riven and participating in team fights can be effective.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Riven's high mobility and instant burst damage. Riven can quickly close the gap using her skills and deal significant damage in a short amount of time, making it likely that she will engage before Yorick can summon the Maiden. Additionally, Riven's CC skill combos can restrict Yorick's movement, often causing him to miss opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, Riven can easily deal with Yorick's pets, which can significantly lower Yorick's combat effectiveness.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to prioritize minion farming in the early game to secure CS. By positioning carefully to avoid Riven's attacks and conserving E for slowing, you can somewhat suppress Riven's engages. Once you reach level 6, summon the Maiden at the right moment and aim to counterattack after taking damage from Riven. In team fights, it is advisable to push from the side with the Maiden in mind and to avoid one-on-one situations with Riven. Securing vision and keeping track of Riven's movements will allow for safer gameplay.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has high mobility and burst damage, and her combos, especially at early levels 2-3, are very powerful. Riven's skills involve movement, which allows her to potentially dodge K'Sante's shields and crowd control. Additionally, Riven has strong traits against auto-attack-based skirmishers, making it easier for her to deal damage to tanks like K'Sante. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range and is vulnerable to Riven's harassment from a distance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on minion management in the early lane and be wary of Riven's engages. It is effective to conserve shields and defensive skills until the moment Riven fully commits, allowing for a counterattack. Additionally, using crowd control to predict Riven's movements and taking the initiative can create opportunities for retaliation. Once you gain an advantage in the minion wave, prioritize saving your teleport over roaming, and aim to fulfill your role as a tank in team fights.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Riven's high mobility and burst damage. Riven excels at gaining an advantage in short trades by utilizing her skills, and especially by executing her combos while being cautious of Darius's E and Q stacks, making it easier to deal damage to Darius. Additionally, Riven has a form of crowd control that immobilizes, allowing her to often escape before Darius can close the gap, making it difficult to engage in long trades. Furthermore, Darius has low mobility and cannot avoid Riven's attacks, and since his damage in short trades relies on his passive, there is a high risk of being taken down before he can stack it up.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early lane phase, prioritize avoiding Riven's skills while using Q to farm minions and build up stacks. By aiming for a short all-in after Riven uses her skills, you can create opportunities to leverage Darius's sustained damage. Additionally, after level 6, you can use your R to pursue, so even if Riven uses Flash or summoner spells, it is crucial to focus on Q stacks and wait for the next opportunity. Moreover, in terms of item build, purchasing durability items early to withstand Riven's burst damage can also be effective.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven is strong in close combat and can easily engage Teemo using her blink and crowd control abilities. Riven can quickly close the distance with her E+Q combo, negating Teemo's blind effect while dealing high burst damage. Additionally, Riven excels in short engagements, and even if Teemo uses his blind, he is likely to be taken down by Riven's ultimate or burst damage. Furthermore, Teemo has low base durability, which puts him at risk of being instantly killed by Riven's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early stages of laning, it is important to back off while using Q to apply blind and create distance with E. If Riven is preparing her E+Q combo, prioritize asking for help from your jungler or escaping. Additionally, using Flash to disengage while positioning yourself behind minions can be effective. In terms of item build, prioritizing Nashor's Tooth and choosing AP items like Liandry's Anguish or Rabadon's Deathcap can increase damage and enhance your ability to counter Riven. Furthermore, selecting Mercury's Treads can strengthen your crowd control resistance, and it is also important to place mushrooms in bushes or along your escape route to monitor Riven's approach.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven excels at short-term burst damage and snowballing, making her harassment in lane and kill pressure after level 6 very strong. Riven's combos deal high damage, and especially after using E (shield), she can quickly whittle down Shen with W (stun) followed by repeated Qs. Additionally, Riven is strong against auto-attack-based skirmishers, and Shen's W (which negates auto-attacks) can be easily countered. Furthermore, Shen becomes completely helpless when hit by immobilizing crowd control, making him very vulnerable to Riven's attacks using E (blink).\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to manage the cooldown of E (taunt) and look for opportunities to attack when Riven's skills are on cooldown. While securing CS in lane, you should also use minions to avoid Riven's combos. After level 6, being aware of your teammates' interventions and utilizing R (teleport) to contribute to team fights can increase your chances of countering Riven."
    },
    "loses": {
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn excels at poking from a distance and can attack while maintaining distance from Riven. Riven has powerful burst damage in close combat, but Quinn can avoid Riven's skills by managing that distance. Additionally, by using Quinn's E to dodge Riven's attacks and avoiding short trades, Quinn can gain an advantageous position. After level 6, Quinn has high roaming potential and can influence other lanes, making it easier to contribute to the overall game flow.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it is important to use auto-attacks and skills to poke Riven and force her to use her E and skills. By counterattacking when Riven misses her skills or after she uses her E, it becomes easier to deal damage. Also, securing vision and calling for jungle support can effectively create a numerical advantage against Riven. After level 6, prioritizing roaming without overcommitting and aiming for kills in other lanes can help gain an overall advantage.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton can effectively counter Riven after level 3. Renekton can enhance his skills using Fury, and particularly with his W, he can stun Riven, interrupting her combos. Additionally, Renekton has high sustain and can trade favorably due to his short cooldowns, allowing him to deal damage while taking hits from Riven.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to use W to escape Riven's all-in from level 1 to level 2. After level 3, poke Riven with Q, and when she uses her Q or dash, use W to aim for the stun. After landing the stun, immediately attack and create distance to avoid Riven's counterattack. If you are under the tower, conserve your empowered W and quickly use Q to dash for safe trades.\n\nFurthermore, by choosing PTA, Renekton can deal more effective damage to Riven, especially after level 3, allowing him to maintain an advantage. While Riven becomes powerful after level 6, it is important to leverage Renekton's strengths to trade favorably.",
      "ポッピー": "Poppy has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy can negate Riven's dashes with her W, effectively shutting down Riven's combos. Riven has many mobility skills, and by using Poppy's E to slam her against a wall, Poppy can effectively limit Riven's attacks by stunning her. Additionally, Poppy has low cooldown percentage damage and a high shield, giving her strong dueling potential, allowing her to perform well in 1v1 fights against Riven.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to first observe Riven's W in the early lane phase and avoid unnecessary trades. When Riven dashes in, Poppy can stop her with W and create an opportunity to counterattack. Poppy should use E to slam Riven against a wall, aiming for a stun while looking for a short burst with Q and auto-attacks. By engaging after Riven's skills are on cooldown, Poppy can secure favorable trades against Riven. In team fights, Poppy can prevent Riven's engage, creating advantageous situations for the entire team.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reasons why Nasus is favored against Riven mainly include the following points. First, Nasus can infinitely scale his damage by stacking his Q, making him extremely powerful in the late game. While Riven has high burst damage in the early game, she is often overwhelmed by Nasus's durability and damage in prolonged fights. Additionally, Nasus's W (Wither) reduces Riven's movement and attack speed, making it easier to disrupt her combos and difficult for her to engage.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, it is important to focus on safely farming CS in the early game and reliably hitting Q to stack it. When taking damage from Riven, use E to mitigate damage, and save W for counterattacks when she engages. By using W the moment Riven attacks, you can significantly reduce her damage. Additionally, coordinating with the jungle to attack when Riven is vulnerable can create advantageous situations. Prioritizing armor items in the early game and building Q-enhancing or durability items as you progress into the late game can further solidify your advantage.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and sustainability, making him durable against Riven's burst damage. Additionally, Cho'Gath's R (Feast) has the ability to execute, allowing him to effectively counterattack when Riven engages at low HP. Furthermore, Cho'Gath's W (Feral Scream) provides silence, which can disrupt Riven's skill combos and create situations where Riven cannot use her abilities.\n\nTo take advantage, first, safely farm minions in the early game while being cautious of Riven's burst, maintaining distance with E (Vorpal Spikes) and engaging in a war of attrition. In the mid-game, use R (Feast) to target minions or enemies within kill range, and when Riven attacks, counter with W (Feral Scream) to apply silence. It's important to position near walls or under towers to avoid taking Riven's full combo. Avoid unnecessary short trades and focus on dealing consistent damage to maintain the advantage in fights.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille excels in short trades against Riven, especially by retaliating after Riven uses her skills, making it easier to deal damage. Camille's E can catch Riven off guard, and her R after level 6 can isolate Riven, limiting her mobility and making her vulnerable. Additionally, Camille's passive shield helps mitigate Riven's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to bait Riven's skills between levels 1 and 3 and retaliate the moment she uses her E or W. Camille can combine her Q and auto-attacks to engage in short skirmishes, neutralizing Riven's skills to deal damage. After level 6, using wall hooks to isolate Riven and aiming for guaranteed kills with her R is effective. It's also crucial to position yourself to avoid Riven's ultimate and to avoid prolonged engagements.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high physical defense, making him particularly strong against AD champions. Riven has high burst damage, but Malphite's durability and area CC (R) make it easier to negate Riven's attacks. Additionally, Malphite can poke from a distance with his Q, allowing him to deal damage before Riven can engage. Furthermore, Malphite can use his W to gain an advantage in auto-attack trades, reducing the risk of taking damage from Riven.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, prioritize CS while using Q to deal damage to Riven from a distance. When Riven tries to engage with a combo at level 2 or 3, it's important to use W to apply a slow and retaliate with an auto-attack. After level 6, using R to stop Riven's engage or to initiate in team fights can contribute to the entire team. Additionally, building armor items (like Frozen Heart or Thornmail) early can further reduce Riven's damage and help maintain the advantageous situation.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar can transform into Mega Gnar, which has powerful crowd control (CC), making it easier to negate Riven's skill combos. In particular, Riven has many mobility skills, and by utilizing Gnar's stun and slow, Gnar can limit Riven's movements. Additionally, Gnar has high mobility in his Mini form, allowing him to avoid Riven's attacks while securing CS, which enables him to play favorably in the early lane phase.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to avoid Riven's attacks while securing CS during levels 1-3. Look for opportunities to counterattack after Riven uses her skills, and after level 4, it is effective to play aggressively while being mindful of transforming. Especially when in Mega Gnar form, aim to avoid Riven's skills while looking for a chance to stun and deal damage. After level 6, be cautious of Riven's ultimate while using the transformation to create advantageous situations, which is key to achieving victory.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce excels at high-damage poke from a distance, allowing him to safely chip away at Riven using his Q in cannon form. Additionally, by utilizing Jayce's gate, he can attack while maintaining distance, making it easier to prevent Riven from closing in. Riven is vulnerable to immobilizing crowd control, and if she gets hit by Jayce's knockback or snare, she risks taking significant damage. Furthermore, Jayce has high base damage in the early game, enabling him to capitalize on Riven's vulnerabilities after she uses her skills.\n\nTo maintain the advantage, in the early game, use minions to keep distance from Riven while executing the Q → gate → Q combo to chip away at her health. After forcing Riven to use her E or Q, creating distance makes it harder for her to attack. After level 6, while being cautious of Riven's ultimate, it's important to push towers and roam, taking the opportunity to strike when Riven is isolated. The moment Riven shows a weakness, closing in with E and dealing burst damage can create a favorable situation.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has high burst damage in the early game and can take the initiative against Riven by utilizing his stun. Riven has many mobility skills, and when she is hit by Pantheon's W stun, it becomes difficult for her to retaliate. Additionally, while Riven is strong in prolonged fights, Pantheon can leverage his short-term power in the early game to gain an advantage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively attack using the Q→AA→W combo between levels 1 and 3, and to engage the moment Riven's E (shield) is down. Use Q to manage minions, and once you reach level 6, prioritize roaming to restrict Riven's mobility. In team fights, using R to eliminate enemies in a single blow can significantly impact the overall match.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage. Riven has a high-damage combo in the early game, so caution is necessary, but Singed can utilize his sustained damage and high movement speed to fight effectively. Riven's skills involve movement, so by using Singed's slows and immobilization, you can limit Riven's movement and make it easier to deal damage. Additionally, since Singed has no ranged attacks, he can maneuver advantageously when Riven approaches.\n\nTo gain the advantage, avoid one-on-one fights from the start until level 2, and use Q to farm minions. When Riven dashes in, apply a slow with W and maintain distance while positioning in the middle of the lane. Between levels 3 and 5, Riven can easily land her combos, so instead of chasing, push the minions to gain experience by backing or proxying. After level 6, use R to leverage your durability and mobility for side pushing or roaming, and in team fights, you can spread poison on the enemy ADC from behind with Q, and when Riven jumps in, you can use E to peel her off, allowing you to fight advantageously.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen can gain an upper hand against Riven by engaging in short trades. Once Riven's HP drops to 30%, using Ignite to go all-in can allow Garen to take her down quickly. Additionally, Garen's Q silence can disable Riven's skills, particularly wasting her E, which can help Garen to trade more favorably.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to manage the minion wave and keep Riven away from the minions. When farming CS, Garen should attack with Q and be careful not to get hit by Riven's third Q. After level 6, avoid trading while his ultimate and Ignite are on cooldown, and try to bait Riven's E. By purchasing Ninja Tabi and damage reduction items first, Garen can increase his win rate in 1v1 situations. In team fights, Garen can utilize his strength by using silence to quickly eliminate Riven when she tries to engage.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has powerful CC against Riven, and by using his E, he can cancel Riven's third Q. This allows him to negate Riven's combo and increase his chances of dealing damage. Additionally, Gragas has AoE damage, making it easier to harass Riven as she approaches. Furthermore, by using Gragas's Ult, he can disrupt Riven's formation and gain an advantage in fights.\n\nTo maintain the advantage, it is important to limit Riven's movements while keeping your own space. Force Riven to approach using her Q, and at that moment, use your E to cancel her combo. When harassing, it is effective to deal damage to Riven with Q while having a Lost Chapter, which helps chip away at her health. When Riven tries to go all-in, you can reduce damage with W and then quickly create distance after landing your combo to avoid her attacks. This way, Gragas can maintain a favorable situation against Riven."

    "beats": {
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has strong attack power from the early game and can maneuver advantageously in short skirmishes, especially after level 3. With Irelia's E and W combo, Kail is susceptible to damage and finds it difficult to escape. Additionally, Irelia can disable Kail with her stun effect skills, allowing her to engage before Kail can activate her abilities. Furthermore, Kail is very weak in the early game, and the unfavorable situation against Irelia continues until she reaches level 6, making it hard to secure farm.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to prioritize safety in the early lane phase and farm by keeping the minions close to the tower. Care should be taken to avoid Irelia's skills, especially maintaining distance to dodge her E and W combo. Once reaching level 6, utilizing range to poke and healing with W while avoiding snares is effective. Additionally, using R to deal with Irelia's burst damage and managing TP while securing vision on the sides can help advance the overall situation for the team.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia specializes in short-term assaults and has extremely high burst damage around level 6. Irelia's E ability can stun, which hinders Mundo's healing, especially since Irelia can attack while clearing minions with her Q, making Mundo more susceptible to damage. Additionally, Irelia has a blink ability, allowing her to easily dodge Mundo's attacks and counterattack. Furthermore, Mundo lacks crowd control, limiting his means to counter Irelia's mobility, making it easier for her to take control of the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to be creative with item builds. Purchasing Bramble Vest early can help reduce Irelia's lifesteal, diminishing her healing. It is also crucial to focus on avoiding her E and positioning yourself to not take damage from Irelia's attacks. In team fights, maintaining the frontline and coordinating with allies can help disperse Irelia's burst damage. Finally, it is important to conserve Flash and jumps to ensure you have an escape route when taking damage from Irelia.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Irelia's high mobility and reset potential. Irelia can use her skills to aim for quick engagements, and especially after level 6, she can deal damage instantly with her ultimate, easily taking down Yorick's pets. Additionally, Irelia's skill with a stun effect makes Yorick susceptible to crowd control, often losing opportunities to counterattack. Furthermore, Irelia can poke and steal Yorick's souls, making it easier for her to gain an advantage in lane trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, prioritize using W to clear minions and E to gather souls. It is important to counter Irelia's engage with E and secure an escape route with W. Also, after level 6, it is necessary to summon the Maiden immediately to counter Irelia's attacks. In team fights, focusing on split pushing and pushing side lanes can effectively hinder Irelia's participation in team fights.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high sustain and damage, and especially after level 6, she can initiate powerful trades when her passive is activated. Yone is likely to be incapacitated during trades due to Irelia's E, which has a stun effect, and he has limited means to escape. Additionally, Irelia can increase her attack speed using her skills, allowing her to deal sustained damage, making it difficult for Yone once he gets caught. Furthermore, Irelia has a blink ability, making it easier for her to dodge Yone's attacks, especially making trades with Q3 more challenging.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to pay attention to the following points. First, at level 1, Yone is strong, so actively attacking to leverage the minion advantage is effective. When Irelia is farming minions with her Q, standing near low HP minions and hitting her with Q when she dashes creates opportunities to deal damage. It is also crucial to use E to avoid Irelia's stun and evade trades. After level 6, when facing Irelia's ultimate, it is necessary to be prepared to escape with your own ultimate. Even if you gain an early lead, it is important to play cautiously and maintain a mindset of waiting for Irelia to make mistakes.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has powerful dive capabilities after level 6 and can deal high burst damage instantly. Jayce has an advantage in early harassment, but when Irelia stacks her E and approaches, it becomes difficult for Jayce to avoid her attacks. Additionally, with Irelia's R providing instant damage and her W having a stun effect, Jayce risks taking significant damage if caught. Furthermore, Jayce lacks sustained damage in team fights and is often at a disadvantage against champions with high burst damage like Irelia.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. From the start of the lane until level 3, use long-range Q (Hammer) for harassment while being careful not to push the minions unnecessarily.\n2. After level 3, engage in short trades and maneuver to avoid Irelia's E stacks.\n3. After pushing, be mindful of roaming and secure vision to limit Irelia's blink options.\n4. After level 6, focus on creating distance with acceleration and knockback before Irelia engages, and conserve your Flash.\n5. In team fights, maintain a position in the backline and aim to deal damage safely from range.\n\nBy executing these strategies, you can mitigate Jayce's disadvantages and progress the matchup against Irelia favorably.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia excels at closing the gap and aiming for a quick finish by utilizing her Q reset. Rumble is likely to be temporarily incapacitated by Irelia's E (stun), making it difficult to counter her damage, especially in 1v1 situations. Additionally, since Irelia has a blink ability, Rumble's E and W, which apply slow effects, are less effective at stopping her, making it very troublesome for Rumble, who has limited escape options. Furthermore, Irelia is strong against burst damage and can withstand Rumble's sustained damage, making Rumble's position worse the longer the fight drags on.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to push the minions under the tower at the start of the lane to prevent Irelia's Q resets. Next, managing heat effectively and using skills without overheating is essential. After level 6, be cautious of Irelia's R and ensure safety by fighting under the tower or alongside allies. In team fights, it is crucial to use R to hinder Irelia's approach and to survive while fighting with W. By doing this, you can mitigate Irelia's strengths and turn the battle in your favor.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has the ability to reset her Q using minions and possesses a powerful engage with her E→R, making her strong in close combat. Although Quinn has range, if caught by Irelia's E stun or engage, she loses the chance to retaliate. Additionally, Irelia is strong against burst damage and can easily shrug off Quinn's short trades, making her vulnerable in sustained damage exchanges. Furthermore, Irelia becomes stronger as she levels up, allowing her to take advantage of Quinn's lack of firepower in the late game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Be aware of minion positioning from the start of the lane and harass Irelia from a distance where she cannot Q minions.\n2. Between levels 1 and 5, repeatedly engage in short trades with AA→Q→escape, and avoid getting close when Irelia has stacked minions.\n3. Around level 6, there is an opportunity to retaliate after Irelia uses her R, so be aggressive.\n4. In team fights, if you cannot catch Irelia in the backline, roam and target squishy enemies with range in the frontline.\n5. In item selection, it is important to prioritize grievous wounds early and utilize Quinn's range in fights.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia can deal high damage from the early game by utilizing Q resets, making it difficult for Gwen to avoid her skills. In particular, Irelia's E stun effect can hinder Gwen's attacks. Additionally, after level 6, Irelia can use her R to cut off Gwen's escape routes, making it easier to aim for a quick finish. Gwen has a short range and is susceptible to Irelia's attacks, making it hard to drag the fight into a prolonged battle.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use minions to create distance in the early game and prevent Irelia's Q resets. Timing the use of E creatively and avoiding Irelia's E can reduce the risk of taking damage. Furthermore, after level 6, aiming for short bursts with R and using W to reduce Irelia's reliance on auto-attacks is effective. It is also crucial to quickly gather core items like Riftmaker or Nashor to enhance damage.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high mobility and the ability to attack unilaterally, especially after level 6, when she can use her ultimate to dash in and deal powerful burst damage to Teemo. Additionally, by using Irelia's E, she can safely approach from minions and initiate an attack before being affected by Teemo's blind (Q). While Teemo can nullify Irelia's auto-attacks with his blind effect, Irelia can use her skills to close the gap and deal sustained damage, making Teemo weak to all-ins and vulnerable to ganks or being caught off guard.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Teemo to focus on poking in lane, pushing minions, and placing mushrooms on the side to hinder Irelia's approach. Moreover, he should avoid unnecessary engagements, conserve his Q from a distance, and look for the right timing to dodge Irelia's skills. Furthermore, building items like Nashor's Tooth or Riftmaker can enhance his sustained damage, allowing him to trade favorably against Irelia.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is a champion with high mobility and excels in short trades, allowing her to engage while avoiding Gangplank's barrels. Irelia's skills can increase her attack speed while outmaneuvering the enemy, making it easy for her to dodge Gangplank's harassment attempts with barrels and retaliate. Additionally, Irelia's skills with stun effects pose a high risk of temporarily incapacitating Gangplank, especially since his escape potential is limited, making him vulnerable to crowd control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important for Gangplank to use his barrels to safely farm CS while positioning himself to avoid Irelia's attacks. Also, utilizing his W to cleanse crowd control while healing can enhance his survivability in lane. Furthermore, being aware of Irelia's skill cooldowns and timing attacks when her skills are unavailable can be effective. In the mid to late game, it is essential to focus on his role in team fights, dealing damage from a distance with barrels and his ultimate to contribute while avoiding direct confrontations with Irelia.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is a high-mobility reset-type duelist, particularly focused on quick engagements. Irelia's rapid approach with her Q and her strong potential for skirmishing using her E and R makes it easy for Anbessa to be targeted by her attacks. Additionally, Irelia's skills with stun effects can significantly restrict Anbessa's actions, making it particularly difficult to avoid Irelia's crowd control in team fights. Furthermore, Anbessa has long skill cooldowns and is not suited for prolonged engagements, making it hard to counter Irelia's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to manage minions effectively in the early lane phase and be aware of minion positioning to prevent Irelia's Q resets. Utilizing W's shield to reduce Irelia's damage and looking for counterattack opportunities can be effective. Additionally, being cautious of Irelia's jungle interventions and avoiding overextending will help maintain lane safety. Finally, opting for a tankier build to increase durability will allow Anbessa to trade more favorably against Irelia.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is strong in close combat and can repeatedly attack by utilizing the reset of her Q. Irelia's skills have damage reduction effects, making her resilient to burst damage, which means Kennen is more likely to be counterattacked when he tries to engage. Additionally, Irelia's skill with a stun effect can temporarily incapacitate Kennen, especially in team fights where Kennen is more likely to be targeted by Irelia's R. Furthermore, Kennen has low durability and is susceptible to Irelia's high damage, which is another disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to poke from a distance with Q in the early game to trigger Irelia's Q reset. Also, by not using E recklessly and saving it for escape, Kennen can engage in favorable short trades. After level 6, using R to aim for CC in team fights and coordinating with allies to suppress Irelia is effective. As for items, choosing Rocket or Zhonya is desirable to increase durability while ensuring sustained damage output. It is also important to avoid prolonged fights and use the positioning of minions to block Irelia's dashes.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high kill pressure from early to mid-game and can deal powerful burst damage against Nar's all-in. By utilizing Irelia's Q reset effect and E stun, she can prevent Nar from attacking and instead attack Nar. Additionally, Nar has low base stats in mini form, making him vulnerable to Irelia's attacks. Furthermore, Irelia's skills have few elements that hinder Nar's transformation, making him susceptible to damage before he can become Mega.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm safely under the tower in the early game and prioritize stacking Q to increase damage. Also, timing the use of W to counter Irelia's engage and attacking after she uses her skills can create opportunities for counterattacks. Preparing armor (like Bramble Vest or Ninja Tabi) early to increase durability can also be effective in withstanding Irelia's burst damage. In the mid-game and beyond, it is crucial to be aware of your role in team fights and coordinate to eliminate Irelia.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high damage and has an advantage, especially in one-on-one combat. Irelia can use her skills to increase her attack speed and deal additional magic damage, making it easier to chip away at Sion's durability. Additionally, Irelia's skills with stun effects can temporarily incapacitate Sion, often causing him to lose opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, when Irelia builds lifesteal, Sion is unable to deal damage and ends up being healed, putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Avoid one-on-one combat and focus on farming under the tower. Freezing the minions can help suppress Irelia's push.\n2. When Irelia pushes, take CS while purchasing items like Hollow Radiance or Titanic Hydra to increase durability.\n3. Rush to buy Steelcaps, and then aim for Iceborn Gauntlet, Frozen Heart, or Thornmail to reduce Irelia's damage.\n4. Engage in combat with Irelia only when there is jungle support, and prioritize your role in team fights.\n5. Choose Manaflow Band to resolve mana issues, allowing for more skill usage.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can mitigate the unfavorable matchup against Irelia and fight more advantageously."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax excels in a playstyle that relies on basic attacks, especially with skills that enhance his auto-attacks (AA). Irelia is a champion that fights using her skills, but Jax's E can negate Irelia's AAs and skills, making it easier for him to gain the upper hand in trades. Additionally, Jax gains a powerful attack speed buff after level 8, allowing him to deal high DPS against Irelia as well.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to zone Irelia from minion experience between levels 1 and 3 and actively trade. Initiate trades before Irelia fully stacks her passive and bring the wave to your side to create a favorable situation while avoiding Irelia's skills. Furthermore, attacking when Irelia's passive is not stacked allows you to deal effective damage. If you have Ignite, it often makes trades more favorable, so be sure to use it actively.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and can deal powerful damage, especially when his HP is low. While Irelia has strong burst damage, Warwick's sustain gives him the upper hand in extended fights. Additionally, Warwick has suppression with his E (Fear), which can limit Irelia's movements. After Irelia has used her skills, Warwick can easily create advantageous situations for himself by counterattacking.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, prioritize minions without overextending and use Q to heal. While being cautious of Irelia's E and Q resets, charge up your E (Fear) and look for the right moment to counterattack. It’s a good idea to initiate a counterattack when Irelia is in her W animation. Also, after the opponent has used their skills, it’s important to secure a follow-up with Q→R to suppress them and initiate a 1v1 on the side. Furthermore, using Bramble Vest or other adjustments to counter healing and negate Irelia's sustain can also be effective.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum has both attack power and durability from the early game, making it particularly easy to aim for a quick resolution. Irelia excels at using minions to dash with her Q and maintain distance, but Braum can reduce those opportunities by pushing the minions. Additionally, by saving Braum's CC (W), he can prevent Irelia's engage and create chances for counterattacks. Furthermore, Braum is skilled at tower diving, allowing him to gain an advantage before Irelia reaches level 6.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to actively attack with auto-attacks in the early lane phase (Lv1-3) to pressure Irelia. By pushing the minions, you can reduce Irelia's opportunities to dash with her Q and use CC with W to limit her movements. After level 6, building durability items early can help you gain an advantage in late-game fights. In team fights, Braum should engage first and act as the tank, while Irelia can attack from the side.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite can utilize his sustain from the early game and his R (charge knock-up) to suppress Irelia's reliance on auto-attacks. Irelia becomes stronger by using her Q to kill minions and collect her passive, so it is important for Malphite to manage the minions and reduce Irelia's opportunities to reset her Q. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense and is very strong against AD champions, making it easier for him to withstand Irelia's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, do not force engagements and prioritize securing minions. Poke Irelia with your Q while using your shield to maintain durability. From levels 3 to 5, use your E to gain an advantage in auto-attack trades and avoid the timing when Irelia engages. Once you reach level 6, you can use your R to catch Irelia and create an advantage in one strike. Wave management is also important; try to push the wave towards the tower or freeze it to prevent Irelia from resetting her Q. Choose armor items, and in team fights, initiate with your R first, effectively combining with your allies' crowd control to nullify Irelia's kill potential.",
      "セト": "Set has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Set has powerful skills from level 1, and by taking W first, he can trade strongly against Irelia. Irelia needs minions to stack her passive, making it easier for Set to gain an advantage in the early stages. Additionally, Set can use E to cancel Irelia's Q, allowing him to win trades. Furthermore, by purchasing Bramble Vest or Steelcaps, Set can reduce Irelia's damage and maintain an advantage in longer fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to manage the wave first and zone Irelia. Set can play aggressively and build an early lead, continuously applying pressure on Irelia. By repeatedly engaging in short trades and avoiding Irelia's skills while dealing damage, he can look for an all-in opportunity. Against skilled Irelia players, it is possible to counter them by calmly assessing the timing of trades and effectively managing the wave.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed's sustained damage (poison) and fling make it easier to limit Irelia's movements. Singed excels at proxy farming, allowing him to harass Irelia with minions while creating a CS lead. Additionally, while Irelia is a champion that excels in short engagements, Singed's poison provides sustained damage and slow effects, which can restrict Irelia's timing to engage.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, harass Irelia with Q from behind the minions while managing your health properly. When Irelia tries to engage, use E to fling her and either wait for your teammates to arrive or lead her under the tower to create a favorable situation. Furthermore, Singed can proxy farm to create an experience lead, allowing him to push the lane advantage. In team fights, it is crucial to spread poison in the frontline while using fling to separate enemies, making it easier for your allies in the backline to deal damage.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control skills, particularly excelling at controlling Irelia's movements with stuns and knockbacks. Additionally, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in all-out situations, enhancing his one-on-one performance, making it easier to gain the upper hand in fights against Irelia. Furthermore, K'Sante has a shield, allowing him to maintain durability against Irelia's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, K'Sante should focus on short trades and it is crucial to avoid Irelia's Q. Since Irelia's Q positions behind K'Sante, keeping the wave near the tower can hinder Irelia's CS. It is recommended to choose Grasp as the rune to gain an early advantage in trades. For item builds, starting with IBG, Tabis, Jackshow, and Bramble is essential, ensuring that K'Sante farms without losing CS before Irelia can secure bottle creeps.\n\nAfter level 6, K'Sante becomes stronger, allowing him to look for all-in opportunities against Irelia. It is also important to avoid Irelia's E and R, especially during trades when she has 4 stacks. In team fights, it is advisable to work with other champions to suppress Irelia's threat. In the early game, preventing Irelia from stacking her passive and inducing early mana consumption can help K'Sante gain an advantage.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo can easily approach Irelia using his E and can block Irelia's Q and R with his W (Wind Wall). Irelia has short-range dashes and healing abilities, but by effectively using Yasuo's Wind Wall, you can negate Irelia's attacks and create opportunities to deal damage in return. Additionally, Yasuo has high DPS and short cooldowns on his skills, making it easy to attack consecutively.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use minions in the early lane phase to safely attack with E→Q without overcommitting. When Irelia engages, save the Wind Wall to block her skills. It is especially crucial to use the Wind Wall to prevent Irelia's R. Creating opportunities for knock-ups and immediately activating your R can deal significant damage to Irelia. If there is an item difference, engage from the front, and if you are losing, focus on CS under the tower while assessing the opponent's movements to secure victory.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora's W (Riposte) can negate Irelia's E (Flawless Duet) stun. This allows her to disable Irelia's CC and gain an opportunity to counterattack. Additionally, Fiora excels in one-on-one situations and can deal significant percentage damage, especially against tanky or juggernaut champions, making it easier for her to gain the upper hand against Irelia.\n\nTo take advantage, first manage the minions in the early lane phase and pay attention to Irelia's Q resets. Avoid aggressive plays and maintain a position where you can counterattack, saving W for moments when E is likely to hit. By using Riposte the moment Irelia's E connects, you can return the stun and initiate an all-in.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to use minions to force Irelia to use her Q, depleting her resets. After level 6, utilize R (Grand Challenge) to draw out the fight, maximizing Fiora's strengths. Focus on lifesteal and defense in items and runes, and be mindful of health and damage when facing Irelia. Lastly, consider using Irelia's blink to receive jungle assistance and ensure vision to prepare for ganks.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton has high sustain and short cooldown skills, making it easier for him to gain an upper hand, especially in lane trades. Irelia has longer cooldowns on her skills, and particularly when she misses her E, it creates an opportunity for counterattacks. Additionally, Renekton's W can deflect Irelia's attacks while dealing damage, allowing for favorable trades.\n\nTo take advantage, first, you cannot win against Irelia at level 1, so wait until level 2 without going for CS. After reaching level 2, use E to close the gap and initiate trades while dodging Irelia's skills. Especially when Irelia misses her E, you can effectively deal damage by attacking with E1 and using W for empowered auto-attacks. Once you reach level 6, if Irelia misses her E, it's important to use R to go all-in and use Ignite early to hinder her healing. Also, avoid fighting when Irelia's passive is stacked, and be mindful to dodge stuns during W.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has powerful sustained damage against melee champions, particularly excelling in long trades. Irelia has high mobility and reset potential, but Darius can limit Irelia's movements by pulling and restraining her with his E. Additionally, Darius's passive provides continuous damage and healing, allowing him to endure Irelia's attacks and excel in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, start by utilizing the outer edge of Q from levels 1 to 2 to heal while stacking Hemorrhage. Be cautious of Irelia's Q resets, approach with E to restrain her, and layer damage with Q and W. Especially after level 3, be mindful of Hemorrhage stacks and manage distance when taking Irelia's attacks, looking for opportunities to counterattack. After level 6, while being wary of Irelia's R, you can leverage Darius's powerful burst in coordination with your allies' crowd control to gain an advantage in fights. As for items, purchasing early boots or Grievous Wounds can help you effectively handle the matchup against Irelia.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing abilities, making him good at lane maintenance. Additionally, Garen's Q silence can prevent Irelia from using her skills, which is particularly advantageous in short trades. Irelia has high mobility and excels in sustain and burst damage, but Garen's true damage R allows him to deal powerful damage in one-on-one combat.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, use E in front of the minions and repeatedly apply silence with Q for short trades. It's important to be cautious of Irelia's Q dives and minion resets, avoiding unnecessary long trades. Use W to reduce incoming damage, and after level 6, look for opportunities to use R to secure kills. Additionally, securing vision and utilizing jungle support can create more favorable situations. Purchasing items early and building tankiness is also crucial to increase durability against Irelia.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven is strong against auto-attack-based skirmishers and can easily deal damage while locking down Irelia's attacks with crowd control. Riven's skills can maximize damage through consecutive use, giving her an edge, especially in short trades. Additionally, Riven has ample mobility with her blinks, making it easier to dodge Irelia's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the laning phase, use Q to clear minions and bait Irelia's Q for a counter. It's important to dodge the opponent's attacks with E and land a combo (Q×3→W→AA→R) with the stun from W. After level 6, be cautious of Irelia's R resets, and forcing her to use her dash (Q) before engaging is key to victory. Also, purchasing health items early can create a health advantage, allowing for even more favorable trades.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has high durability and can easily absorb Irelia's one-shot combo. Shen's E taunt can negate Irelia's attacks and provide an opportunity for counterattacks. Additionally, Shen's R can support allies from an infinite range, allowing him to maintain lane pressure while also impacting other lanes.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to harass with Q while positioning minions in lane, and to use E to take aggro the moment Irelia dashes into minions with her Q. Once you reach level 6, it's effective to use R to protect allies before the enemy attempts to roam or engage in a 1v1, creating opportunities to call for jungle assistance. In team fights, you can protect allies with R while serving as a tank on the front line, and by using W to negate Irelia's auto-attack damage, you can suppress her attacks.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high durability and powerful crowd control, which can effectively disrupt Irelia's engage. In particular, Cho'Gath's Q (knock-up) and W (silence) can limit Irelia's movement as she approaches, allowing him to attack before she can activate her skills. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high sustain and excellent lane maintenance, making it easier to withstand Irelia's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, avoid unnecessary aggression and focus on farming CS with E while harassing. Be mindful of Irelia's Q cooldown and time your attacks accordingly. After level 3, use the Q→W combo to prevent her from closing the gap, and time your Q to hit her as she engages, nullifying her attack. After level 6, it's important to assess the timing to go for kills with R, avoid isolated 1v1s, and stick with your teammates. In terms of build, prioritizing items like Bramble Vest and heavy armor early can reduce Irelia's damage and allow for a more favorable fight.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration and the ability to become immortal with his ultimate, making it easier for him to gain the upper hand in a one-on-one fight against Irelia. Specifically, by using Tremendous's R, he can negate Irelia's stuns and damage, allowing him to continue attacking persistently. Additionally, Tremendous can utilize Fury to increase his critical hit rate, resulting in high damage output in short skirmishes, enabling him to quickly whittle down Irelia's HP.\n\nTo gain an advantage, first, freeze the minions on your side between levels 1 and 3 to prevent Irelia from resetting her Q. During this time, it is important not to engage unnecessarily and to avoid Irelia's harassment. From levels 3 to 5, use E to close the distance while attacking from outside Irelia's harassment and stun range, managing HP with W and potions. Once you reach level 6, utilize your ultimate to aim for a one-on-one fight, charging in after Irelia has used her E. In team fights, maneuver around to target the backline, using R at the right moment to survive, effectively turning the battle in your favor."

      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax can negate Irelia's attacks by using his E (Counter), which poses a significant risk when Irelia tries to engage in trades. Additionally, Jax has strong scaling, and his ability to deal sustained damage increases as he levels up. While Irelia is strong in short trades, she tends to struggle against Jax in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Irelia is weak against CC (crowd control), and if Jax uses his E at the right moment, Irelia will lose her opportunity to retaliate.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on last-hitting minions in the early game while using Q to deal short bursts of damage and avoid Jax's E. Additionally, using W to block Jax's attacks while looking for a chance to counterattack is necessary. After level 6, utilizing Irelia's R to create opportunities for significant damage and transitioning into a longer fight can be effective. Moreover, creatively building items and runes to enhance sustained damage is also crucial for countering Jax.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is very strong from the early game, especially with the E-W-Q combo, which can significantly reduce Kail's HP. Kail is weak in the early game, and until she reaches level 6, her means to counter Jax are limited. Additionally, Jax is an AA-dependent champion, making it difficult for Kail to utilize her range, and if he gets close, she finds herself in a tough situation. Furthermore, since Kail lacks hard CC to counter Jax's CC skill with a stun, she becomes more susceptible to his attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to utilize the range advantage and harass while maintaining distance from Jax. Specifically, when Jax approaches, using W to escape can help reduce damage. Additionally, using E's splash to stack favor and apply pressure can also be effective. Furthermore, gathering 2.5 items (Berserker's, Nashor's, Rageblade) increases the chances of dueling with Jax. Seeking help from the jungle can also be effective, as it can put Jax in a bad position and set up for a gank. Finally, if you cannot gain an early lead, it may be wise to consider farming under the tower after level 6, as Jax becomes stronger then.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is a champion that scales well into the late game, particularly excelling in AA (auto-attack) reliant fights. While Braum is strong in early skirmishes, if Jax uses his E (Counter) to negate Braum's AAs, Braum's attacks become ineffective. Additionally, after level 6, Jax can use his R (Ultimate) to prolong his life and withstand Braum's attacks, putting Braum at a disadvantage in team fights and 1v1 situations. Furthermore, Braum's main skills have short range, making it difficult to respond to Jax's leap skills for chasing or escaping.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Lane Management**: Braum should actively overwhelm Jax in the early game and prioritize CS (Creep Score). It’s advisable to engage after using skills to bait out Jax's E.\n2. **Utilizing Ganks**: Braum should actively gank from the jungle and support other lanes to establish an overall advantage. It is particularly effective to target moments when Jax is isolated.\n3. **Item Build**: Braum should prioritize building durability items early to gain an advantage in trades against Jax. It is important to prioritize tank items to withstand Jax's damage.\n4. **Role in Team Fights**: Braum should take the initiative in team fights and maneuver to prevent Jax from creating 1v1 situations. Coordinating with allies to avoid isolating Jax is crucial.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax can use his E (Counter Strike) to negate Yasuo's basic attacks and counterattack, taking advantage of Yasuo's low early game base stats. Yasuo excels at harassing by stacking his Q early on, but if Jax is saving his E, he can block Yasuo's attacks, making it necessary for Yasuo to avoid short trades. Additionally, Jax becomes stronger in the late game, and after level 6, equipping Trinity Force or Sterak's Gage increases his 1v1 strength, putting Yasuo in a very tough situation if he is attacked when he cannot use his ultimate.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Yasuo to prioritize CS in the early game and maintain the lane. Yasuo should time his E to block Jax's attacks and aim to counterattack with Q + AA after negating them. Furthermore, prioritizing items like Phantom Dancer and Infinity Edge, while choosing Mercury's Treads or Ninja Tabi based on the situation, can increase his survivability. Making an early recall to secure sustain and leveraging his strengths before taking Jax's powerful attacks is crucial.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has an E skill that can negate auto-attacks (AA), which allows him to reduce Camille's damage. Especially in the mid-game, as Jax's E cooldown becomes shorter, Camille struggles significantly when trying to trade. Additionally, Jax has high DPS and can deal sustained damage due to his attack speed buffs, making it easy for him to retaliate even when Camille attempts short trades. Furthermore, Camille lacks AoE damage and has difficulty positioning in team fights, making it hard to counter Jax's strong scaling.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid trading in lane and to bait Jax's E. Specifically, using W and Q2 to lure out Jax's E and hitting him near minions can help turn the lane in Camille's favor. Additionally, ending the game early before Jax scales or coordinating with teammates to suppress Jax can also be effective. Moreover, selecting the right items and equipping gear that can counter Jax is crucial.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax's E (Counter Strike) can negate Yone's basic attacks. Jax is an auto-attack-focused champion, and by using his E, he can block Yone's attacks while also stunning him. This means that Yone takes risks when trying to engage, especially in prolonged fights after level 6, where Jax gains the upper hand. Additionally, Jax can deal high DPS against Yone, who has low base health and defenses, making Yone susceptible to unfavorable trades in the early to mid-game once Jax is properly equipped.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it's important to focus on harassing in lane and using E (Spirit Blossom) to chip away at Jax's health. After provoking Jax's E, attacking when it expires makes it easier to deal damage. Furthermore, in terms of item selection, choosing plated armor or health + resist items can enhance durability, allowing Yone to withstand Jax's attacks. Additionally, managing minions without pushing the lane too hard and being mindful of the sides can help avoid harassment from Jax.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax scales well into the late game and is a champion with a high win rate in one-on-one situations. In particular, Jax has skills that enhance his basic attacks, allowing him to deal high DPS with attack speed buffs. While Warwick is strong in early skirmishes, Jax's strength reverses as he grows. Additionally, Jax's E ability can negate attacks, hindering Warwick's offense and creating particularly unfavorable situations. Furthermore, Jax excels at split-pushing, making it difficult for Warwick to catch up, which allows Jax to exert pressure on the map.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forced one-on-ones in the early game and focus on farming. After level 6, utilizing Warwick's R to counter Jax and timing the pursuit with E is necessary. Additionally, securing vision and prioritizing dragons and objectives while being cautious of Jax's movements can help fulfill a role in team fights. In terms of item selection, opting for tank-oriented gear can increase durability and improve survival rates when facing Jax.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremdamer is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax can negate Tryndamere's auto-attacks with his E (Counter Strike), giving him an advantage in trades. Especially in the early game, Jax can absorb Tryndamere's attacks while saving his E for a counterattack. Additionally, Jax can deal high burst damage with his W (Stack), potentially inflicting damage before Tryndamere uses his R (Undying Rage). Furthermore, Jax can deal sustained damage after level 6, making it easier for him to create advantageous situations even after Tryndamere uses his R.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Tryndamere to avoid long trades in the early game and engage in short auto-attack exchanges. Using E (Spinning) to time his attack when Jax's E is down and attacking while healing with Q (Spinning Slash) is effective. Additionally, purchasing critical strike items and lifesteal early on is necessary to enhance sustained combat ability. Moreover, buying boots early can also improve mobility for evasion and chasing.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Jax is an AA (auto-attack) reliant champion and can negate Set's CC (crowd control) skill, E (stun), making it difficult for Set to trade. Additionally, Jax has a powerful attack speed buff and high sustained damage output, which allows him to capitalize on his advantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Set has limited mobility options, making it hard to approach unless Jax's E is on cooldown, leaving him vulnerable to harassment.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to time your attacks when Jax's E is on cooldown. Specifically, saving W before Jax uses his ultimate and using it as a finishing blow can help you trade more favorably. Also, consider slow-pushing the wave to apply pressure on Jax while seeking help from your jungler if necessary. Moreover, to avoid Jax's E, it is crucial to be aware of the AA+AA+Q+Q combo and maneuver in a way that minimizes taking damage from Jax's attacks.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has strong 1v1 capabilities and can easily outscale Ornn in terms of itemization. In particular, by using Jax's E (dodge + stun), he can avoid Ornn's CC (crowd control) while counterattacking. Additionally, Ornn tends to struggle with short-term damage output, and managing incoming damage is crucial, but it is difficult to counter Jax's high DPS due to his attack speed buff. Furthermore, in team fights, Jax can easily be contained by Ornn's CC, making it challenging for Ornn to play advantageously.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to safely manage minions in the early lane phase, processing waves with Ornn's W/Q while taking short trades when Jax's E is on cooldown. Additionally, Ornn can apply pressure on Jax by coordinating ganks with his E/R CC. Furthermore, purchasing items early and aiming to scale into the late game can enhance Ornn's impact in team fights. Jungle intervention is also crucial, as it is necessary to secure kills while being cautious of Jax's counterattacks.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has strong attack power from the early game, and especially with his E, he can avoid Nasus's normal attacks while stunning him, making Nasus vulnerable to quick engagements. Additionally, Nasus is very weak in the early game, and if he cannot farm effectively, he is likely to struggle in the mid to late game. Jax is an auto-attack reliant champion, and Nasus's W slow and attack speed reduction are effective, but if Nasus fails to trigger Jax's E properly, he will miss the opportunity to counterattack.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play safely at the start of the lane and prioritize stacking Q with the last hit. Waiting for or provoking Jax's E and then using Q to counterattack during its cooldown is crucial. Additionally, purchasing armor items like Ninja Tabi or Bramble Vest early can help withstand Jax's attacks by countering lifesteal. After reaching level 6, utilizing R to endure and either re-stacking Q after Jax uses his E or splitting to prolong the game can help leverage Nasus's strength.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is an AA (auto-attack) reliant champion, and Gwen's CC skill with slow effects cannot completely stop Jax's attacks. Jax can negate auto-attacks with his E, allowing him to deal high DPS, making it easy for Gwen to fall behind in trades. Additionally, Jax can launch powerful attacks against Gwen, who has low base health and defenses, from the early game, and especially after level 6, he can gain an advantage in trades using his R. Furthermore, Gwen has a short range, making it difficult to avoid Jax's attacks, and she is vulnerable to sustained harassment, which also contributes to her disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to be aware of Jax's E cooldown and to time your attacks after he uses it. Between levels 1 and 3, you should farm using your Q while maneuvering to avoid Jax's E. After level 6, you can create opportunities for counterattacks by trading after Jax uses his E. In terms of item build, prioritizing Riftmaker can enhance your power spike, giving you better tools to counter Jax. Additionally, applying pressure from a distance with your Q and attacking when Jax's E is on cooldown can help you gain an advantage in trades.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has high DPS that relies on basic attacks, making him particularly strong against champions that focus on auto-attacks. Jax's E (Counter Strike) provides damage reduction, which makes it easier to negate Renekton's attacks and contributes to losing the advantage in trades. Additionally, during Jax's ultimate, he gains extra armor, making it difficult for Renekton to deal effective damage when he engages. Furthermore, Renekton has low base health and defenses, and is highly reliant on items, making it hard to recover if he falls behind early.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force fights while Jax's ultimate is active, and instead bait him before going all-in. By drawing out Jax's E before attacking, it becomes easier to gain an advantage in trades. Since Renekton cannot win against Jax at early levels, it is crucial to prepare items after the first back and focus on short trades to gradually gain an advantage. Utilizing Q and W to chip away at Jax while being careful not to use W during the animation of his E can help make trades more favorable.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is an auto-attack (AA) reliant champion with an attack speed buff, giving him very high DPS in close combat. Mordekaiser is designed for melee combat, but his only means of engaging, his E, has a long cooldown, making it difficult to avoid Jax's attacks. Additionally, Jax has a skill that can negate auto-attacks, making it hard for Mordekaiser to land hits, especially in one-on-one fights. Furthermore, Jax can use his leap skill to escape or chase, making it challenging for Mordekaiser to attack unilaterally.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid harassment in lane and safely farm as much as possible. When taking Jax's attacks, utilizing shields to reduce damage can be effective. As for items, purchasing Seeker's Armguard early to increase durability can be helpful. Additionally, using Grasp or Bone Plating to enhance durability while trading can create opportunities to fight more favorably, even if just slightly."
    },
    "loses": {
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn possesses high mobility and burst damage, and she demonstrates strong denial against melee champions. Jax is an auto-attack reliant fighter who excels at closing in and dealing normal attacks, but Quinn can avoid Jax's attacks by utilizing her harassment from a distance and her mobility. Additionally, Jax has low base stats in the early game, making levels 1-3 a favorable time for Quinn to engage.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, it's important to first use E to negate Jax's attacks, then push the wave with Q to roam mid lane or teleport to bot lane to farm. By using aggressive harass with auto-attacks instead of Volt, and attacking after Jax has used Flash, you can create advantageous situations while avoiding his counterattacks. Furthermore, a defensive build is unnecessary until the first four items, and by maximizing E and purchasing Ghostblade first, you can further increase your damage output.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has high healing capabilities, especially with the sustain from his Q, which allows for great durability in lane. Additionally, by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W, he can easily avoid Jax's attacks and deal sustained damage in team fights. Furthermore, Bloodmire has range, enabling him to harass while avoiding Jax's melee attacks, making it easier to maintain lane control.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, focus on farming with Q while healing, and as you level up, look for opportunities to use E to dodge Jax's attacks. Particularly after level 6, aim for attacks that incorporate R, countering Jax after he uses E, allowing you to deal damage while staying alive. Also, prioritize items like Zhonya's and Riftmaker to increase durability, giving you an edge in trades against Jax. In team fights, it's important to use R to attack from a safe position, targeting Jax's flanks or taking down carries.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled can trade powerfully against Jax before level 6. Kled's W has high damage, and by avoiding Jax's E stun, he can deal sustained damage. Additionally, Kled's E is very effective as a means to close the gap to the enemy, allowing him to attack while dodging Jax's strikes. Furthermore, Kled has high single-target damage and excels in one-on-one and small skirmishes, giving him an edge in direct combat against Jax.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively trade before level 6, dealing damage to Jax to gain a lead. Using Q to poke, dealing damage with W, and then using E to create distance while avoiding Jax's counterattacks is effective. It is also crucial to be mindful of spacing to avoid entering the range of Jax's E and getting stunned. Additionally, purchasing tenacity items (e.g., Mercury's Treads) can increase resistance to Jax's crowd control, allowing for a more favorable fight.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has powerful crowd control, and particularly with his W (Silence), he can disrupt Jax's E (Counter Strike). This prevents Jax from blocking auto-attacks, reducing his chances to deal damage. Additionally, by using Cho'Gath's Q (Rupture) to harass over minions, he can apply sustained pressure on Jax. Furthermore, at level 6, Cho'Gath can use his R (Feast) to aim for kills while continuing to farm and prioritize stacking.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, manage the minions at the start, with Cho'Gath applying pressure with Q while Jax conserves his E. During harassment, Cho'Gath uses W to limit Jax's actions and engages in short skirmishes. Upon reaching level 6, Cho'Gath aims for kills with R, while Jax should not miss any opportunities to counterattack. As item differences emerge, Cho'Gath focuses on increasing his durability with MR and HP in preparation for team fights. In team fights, Cho'Gath maintains the frontline, using W to immobilize enemies, while Jax can take advantage by attacking from the side to target the carries.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing capabilities, making him good at maintaining his lane. Jax is weak in the early game and highly reliant on items, allowing Garen to establish an advantage early on. Additionally, Garen's Q can silence Jax, negating Jax's E and reducing his opportunities to counterattack. Furthermore, Garen's R deals true damage, allowing him to bypass Jax's defenses and deal damage.\n\nTo take advantage, when Jax approaches, you should counterattack with E while using W to prevent being stunned, looking for the right moment to land Q. Especially when Jax has Lethal Tempo, you can chip away at his HP with light trades while W is on cooldown. After level 6, you can utilize Garen's powerful ultimate skill to pressure Jax.\n\nAlso, using bushes to ambush can be effective. By using Q from the bush to take the initiative, you can deal damage to Jax while leveraging Garen's passive healing to maintain your lane. Repeated short trades, and once Jax's HP is below half, you should actively engage in attacks.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo is strong in prolonged battles and has high self-healing capabilities, allowing him to gain the upper hand in a long fight against Jax. Particularly, Mundo's passive enables him to negate hard crowd control, making it easier for him to maneuver even when taking hits from Jax's E. Additionally, Mundo can farm from a distance with his Q while avoiding Jax's harassment, making it easier to maintain his lane in the early game.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to farm while poking with Q in the early game and to avoid unnecessary engagements. After forcing Jax to use his E, engage in close trades, and avoid fighting while his E is available. After level 6, use R to fight tenaciously, carefully assessing when to engage and when to back off. Also, building armor items early (like Bramble Vest) can help mitigate Jax's healing. Finally, coordinating with the jungle to engage Jax when his E is unavailable can provide further advantages.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo excels at harassing from a distance and can nullify Jax's basic attacks with his Q (Blind). Since Jax relies on auto-attacks (AA), Teemo's blind effect is very effective. Additionally, Teemo can zone Jax by placing mushrooms, preventing him from getting close. Furthermore, Teemo can go invisible, making him good at ambushing.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, poke Jax with Q and AA through minions while securing CS. Place mushrooms in the bushes to gain vision, and when Jax approaches, use the mushrooms to deal damage. As the mid-game approaches, be aware that Jax may become aggressive when he reaches level 6, so it's important to focus on trading safely and conserving your Flash. In team fights, use mushrooms to limit enemy movement, preventing Jax from getting close while targeting from the backline.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control (CC) skills, particularly excelling at using stuns and knockbacks to control Jax's attacks. Since Jax relies on auto-attacks (AA), utilizing K'Sante's CC to negate his attacks can help mitigate damage. Additionally, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in all-out mode, enhancing his performance in one-on-one fights, making it easier to gain the upper hand against Jax.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to play carefully from level 1 and avoid Jax's E. Use W to prevent Jax's E stun, and then deal continuous damage with Q. After Jax uses E, it is important to attack using K'Sante's Q and passive while maintaining distance. Also, when Jax performs an AA, kiting and counterattacking can minimize his damage. In team fights, it is also important to use K'Sante's CC to control Jax and protect allies.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi has high base stats and healing abilities, and her attacks utilizing tentacles are particularly powerful. Jax has low health and defense in the early game and is highly dependent on items, making it difficult for him to withstand Illaoi's sustained damage. Additionally, Illaoi can pull Jax in with her E skill, the Test of Spirit, applying a slow effect that can restrict Jax's attacks. Furthermore, Illaoi is extremely strong in fights within areas where her tentacles are present, allowing her to deal damage as Jax tries to approach.\n\nTo take advantage, positioning at level 1 is crucial. Illaoi can set up her tentacles and wait for Jax to come close, dealing damage to him while maintaining her own HP. When Jax uses his Q to attack, she can hit him with her E to pull him in, dealing damage and applying a slow to limit his movement. It's also important to be aware of fighting in areas with tentacles and to utilize them to increase damage. In team fights, she can use her tentacles to deal damage to surrounding enemies and overwhelm them with her R skill.\n\nIn this way, Illaoi has many advantageous elements against Jax, and particularly her playstyle from early to mid-game is key to victory.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in the lane. Specifically, by using his Q skill to deal damage to Jax while utilizing the Bandit mastery, he can keep Jax at low HP. Additionally, Gangplank's barrels can penetrate Jax's E, allowing him to actively use them after level 7 to negate Jax's attacks while dealing damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to attack Jax with the Q skill in the lane and continue harassing. If Jax goes for an all-in, wait for his E and then use W to escape with a speed boost while chasing with Q, allowing you to dodge Jax's attacks and counterattack. Also, bringing a Corrupting Potion on your first back and purchasing a Doran's Blade will enable sustained harassment and healing, maintaining lane dominance. Furthermore, Gangplank can also gain an advantage in team fights by effectively using his ultimate and barrels, so as long as he doesn't lose the lane, he can scale just as well.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has sustained damage from a distance, and his laning phase is particularly strong from levels 1 to 3. By using Urgot's Q and W to harass Jax, you can chip away at Jax's health and create a level advantage. Additionally, Urgot can utilize his CC skills, which include stuns and pulls, to limit Jax's movement, allowing him to gain an advantage in short trades.\n\nTo take advantage, first, use Urgot's Q and W to harass Jax in the early game and reduce his health. By provoking Jax's E, you can maintain a favorable minion wave and create a situation where Jax finds it difficult to attack. After level 3, it is important to engage in short trades the moment Jax uses his E and aim for a kill with your ultimate. After level 6, Jax becomes stronger, so avoid risky 1v1s and focus on securing vision while coordinating with your teammates to fight effectively.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has ranged attacks and excels at harassment. Specifically, from level 1, he can safely deal damage to Jax using his Q, while preserving Jax's E, making it easier to create opportunities for attacks. Additionally, Kennen can leverage his W's stun to gain an advantage in short skirmishes. Furthermore, Kennen has high crowd control in team fights, as he can deal damage over a wide area with his R while stunning enemies, making him powerful in team engagements.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from level 1 to level 3, use Q to harass Jax and safely deal damage by incorporating auto-attacks through minions. After Jax uses his E, it’s a chance to harass or roam, so it’s important to be aggressive. Also, after level 6, initiate team fights using R, aiming for stuns with W while maneuvering to avoid Jax's attacks, allowing you to fight from a position of strength.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has ranged attacks from the early game and can continuously harass with his Q, making it easier to chip away at Jax's health. Additionally, by using Rumble's E (slow), he can hinder Jax's approach, especially by engaging before Jax uses his E (Counter), making it easier to deal damage. Furthermore, Rumble's R (Equalizer) has a powerful zoning effect in team fights and one-on-one situations, making it difficult for Jax to get close.\n\nTo take advantage, first, continue to harass with Q in the early game while using minions as a shield to maintain distance and chip away at Jax's health. Check Jax's E cooldown and engage with Q when it is unavailable. Also, after level 6, use R to limit Jax's movements, and in team fights, aim to position EQ to group enemies together for a more advantageous situation.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage from the early game, and since Jax has low base health and defense, Singed's poison harassment is effective. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed, allowing him to avoid Jax's attacks while fighting, making it difficult for Jax to land many auto-attacks. Furthermore, by using Singed's crowd control skills (slows and stuns), he can limit Jax's movement and prevent him from closing the gap.\n\nTo take advantage, first, perform proxy farming in the early lane to deny Jax CS. Next, while spreading poison with Singed's W, bait Jax's E and deal damage with a short trading (W→E). After level 6, it’s important not to force trades; instead, focus on split-pushing with teleport and team fights, keeping your distance when Jax looks to all-in. Choosing a build that emphasizes health regeneration and durability can increase survivability and lead to prolonged fights.",
      "アカリ": "Akali has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali possesses high mobility and burst damage, allowing her to deal damage while avoiding Jax's attacks. In particular, by using Akali's Smoke Bomb (W), she can obscure Jax's vision and negate his attacks, effectively dodging his normal attacks and skills. Additionally, Akali has a continuous blink (E), which enables her to avoid Jax's stun (E) and maintain an advantage in close combat.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, it is important for Akali to utilize her skills to harass Jax and secure CS in the early game. After level 3, she should use E to approach Jax, deal damage with Q, and block his counterattacks with W by obscuring his vision. In the mid-game, increasing points in E will help counter Jax's E, and combining Q and E to initiate attacks will prevent Jax from stacking his passive. In the late game, as Jax becomes stronger, it is crucial to play carefully and time the use of her Shroud (R) to escape effectively.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick has high base stats, particularly excelling in health growth, making him very durable. Additionally, by using Yorick's Q, \"Mistwalker,\" he can overwhelm opponents and easily control the lane by summoning ghouls. Furthermore, he can avoid Jax's E (Dodge) and attack with Q and auto-attacks when the E is on cooldown, while also avoiding prolonged fights. Jax is weak in the early game and often finds himself in a tough situation when taking damage from Yorick.\n\nTo take advantage, start by pushing the minions from level 1 and applying pressure with ghouls. At level 3, summon the Maiden to initiate zoning and trading. Look for the moment Jax's E is on cooldown to attack with the E→Q→auto-attack combo for damage. Additionally, utilize split-pushing in side lanes and apply pressure with drafts and TP to gain an advantage over Jax. In team fights, it is crucial to position the Maiden in front to overwhelm the opponents.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has strong crowd control and AoE damage against Jax, who is highly reliant on auto-attacks, making it easier to negate Jax's normal attacks. In particular, Gragas can safely deal damage through minions with his Q (Barrel), allowing him to chip away at Jax before he gets close. Additionally, by using Gragas's E (Body Slam) and R (Explosive Cask), he can avoid Jax's attacks or knock Jax back to create a favorable situation.\n\nTo take advantage, start by using Q to poke at the minions at the beginning of the lane, and when Jax approaches, use E to create distance. When Jax gets close to the barrel with his Q, retreat with E and aim for a knockback with R to counter. After saving Jax's E (Counter Strike), deal damage with the E→W→Q combo to secure a favorable trade before taking any hits from Jax. After level 6, it’s important to be mindful of Jax's long-term combat potential while using R to maintain distance during fights. For items, choose durability-focused gear (like Zhonya's or Seraph's) to withstand Jax's attacks while continuing to poke with Q, allowing you to maintain the advantage."

      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has high mobility and true damage, allowing him to attack while negating Teemo's blind effect. Although Teemo can gain an advantage in range, when Olaf lands his axe (Q) and closes the distance, it becomes difficult for Teemo to retaliate. Additionally, Olaf's healing from his W reduces Teemo's damage, putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, when Olaf uses his R to negate crowd control, Teemo loses opportunities to attack and faces a higher risk of being attacked instead.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:\n1. In the early lane phase, blind Olaf with Q from behind minions and poke from a distance to prevent his approach.\n2. Place mushrooms (R) in bushes and drag spots to limit Olaf's movement, making it harder for him to close in.\n3. Counterattack with E or auto-attacks when Olaf throws his axe, maintaining distance while fighting.\n4. After level 6, use R to secure vision and focus on chipping away at enemies with poison from an angle during team fights.\n5. Engage after Olaf's R has been used, and either escape or attack after seeing his R to reduce risk.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Teemo's disadvantages and turn fights in his favor.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has strong damage and sustain from the early game, and his auto-attack (AA) damage is high, which forces Yone to avoid AAs. Additionally, Olaf can increase his attack power while negating crowd control with his ultimate, allowing him to engage in powerful skirmishes even when his HP is low. Yone is highly item-dependent and struggles to counter Olaf until he is fully equipped, making him particularly vulnerable to attacks that exploit Olaf's HP advantage. Furthermore, Olaf's Q, which has a slow effect, limits Yone's escape options, creating a situation that is unfavorable for him against Olaf.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play passively in the early game and safely accumulate chip damage using Q. Prioritizing E is necessary to secure an escape option. Preparing lifesteal and defense through items, Yone should aim to combine R and Q for burst damage in the later stages of the lane. Additionally, timing Olaf's ultimate and coordinating with the jungle for roams can help alleviate pressure against Olaf.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf can apply strong pressure from the early game, especially with his ability to secure short trades at levels 2 and 3. Olaf's Q axe throw and E true damage are very tough for Gwen, who struggles in extended trades early on, making her susceptible to Olaf's attacks. Additionally, Olaf can attack while negating crowd control with his R, making it easy for Gwen to miss her opportunity to counterattack. As the game progresses, Gwen's healing and area damage become powerful, but if she allows Olaf to gain an early lead, he is likely to take advantage of it.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on safely farming CS in the early game and to be aware of dodging Olaf's Q with E. At levels 2 and 3, Olaf is strong, so it’s best to avoid prolonged engagements and instead perform short hit-and-run trades with Q → AA → W while checking for the presence of Olaf's E. Once reaching level 6, using R when Olaf engages can create a safe zone, allowing for an effective counterattack with E → Q → W afterward. Additionally, in terms of item selection, prioritizing durability is crucial to withstand Olaf's attacks while increasing sustained damage output.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has strong damage in early skirmishes and can attack while negating CC with his R ability, making it difficult for Warwick's R ability to land. Additionally, Olaf can heal himself with his W ability and becomes stronger as his HP decreases, which can make Warwick's healing ability less effective in prolonged fights. Furthermore, if Olaf closes the distance with his Q ability, it becomes harder for Warwick to retaliate.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid taking unnecessary risks in the early game and to coordinate with teammates to dodge Olaf's attacks. After level 6, it is effective to activate Warwick's R ability when Olaf's R ability is on cooldown to secure kills. Additionally, creatively building items to increase durability can help withstand Olaf's attacks. In team fights, targeting priority enemies with Warwick's R from a safe position can also reduce Olaf's impact.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has powerful burst damage from the early game, and he can attack while negating crowd control with his ultimate, making it easier for Cho'Gath to take damage from Olaf. Additionally, Olaf's attack speed and lifesteal increase as his health decreases, allowing him to maintain strong combat capabilities even when he is at low health, making it difficult for Cho'Gath to win in a prolonged fight. Furthermore, while Cho'Gath's W (Silence) can prevent Olaf from using his skills, after Olaf uses his R, it becomes harder for Cho'Gath to land his attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm safely behind minions in the early lane phase and avoid Olaf's attacks. By predicting when Olaf will charge in and saving W (Silence), you can disrupt his skills. Additionally, after Olaf uses his R, saving Cho'Gath's R and aiming to bind him with Q→W→E when Olaf's R expires can help secure a kill. As for items, prioritizing health, armor, and magic resistance will make it easier to withstand Olaf's attacks.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has melee attack power and can negate crowd control with his R. Jayce excels at harassing from a distance in the early game, but after level 6, Olaf's attack power increases, especially as his HP decreases, making him stronger in close combat. Additionally, if Olaf closes the distance with the slow effect from his Q, it becomes difficult for Jayce to escape. Furthermore, although Olaf is equipment-dependent, if he attacks before Jayce can get his items, it becomes hard to turn the situation around.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to use Q and E in cannon form to harass and avoid Olaf's axe (Q). When Olaf misses his axe, actively pursue him and try to maintain distance using minions. Also, placing a ward before reaching level 6 can pressure Olaf by inviting jungle interference. Additionally, when Olaf approaches, be mindful of keeping your distance and minimizing short trades to reduce risk.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has an R that negates CC, and by closing the distance and engaging in a brawl, he can nullify Quinn's strengths. Quinn excels at harassment using her range, but when Olaf uses his R, that harassment can be ignored, and she is likely to find herself in a disadvantageous situation in a melee. Additionally, Olaf becomes stronger as his HP decreases, so if Quinn cannot whittle him down, there is a risk of being counterattacked by Olaf. Furthermore, if Olaf slows her with his Q, it becomes difficult for Quinn to escape, highlighting her vulnerability in ganks and team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, it is important to conserve E to avoid Olaf's Q and maintain distance while harassing.\n2. Purchasing Grievous Wounds items (Executioner's) early can help reduce Olaf's lifesteal, alleviating the disadvantage in brawls.\n3. After level 6, prioritize roaming with R to aim for kills in other lanes, avoiding one-on-one situations with Olaf.\n4. In team fights, focus on attacking from a distance and maintain proper spacing when Olaf approaches to negate the effects of his R.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has an ultimate skill that increases his attack power and movement speed while negating crowd control, and even if Mordekaiser uses his ultimate (R), he cannot negate the effects of Olaf's ultimate, making it difficult to fight favorably in a one-on-one situation. Additionally, Olaf becomes stronger as his HP decreases, giving him an advantage in brawls. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and it is difficult to avoid Olaf's attacks, especially in the early game, which means he cannot exert kill pressure on Olaf and cannot apply pressure in the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to utilize jungle pressure and gank Olaf to regain lane superiority. Additionally, building Morello early on for Mordekaiser can effectively suppress Olaf's lifesteal. Furthermore, building Ninja Tabi or Seeker's Armguard to reduce Olaf's damage and enhance survivability in the lane is also effective. As the game progresses, Mordekaiser becomes more advantageous, so it is necessary to increase durability while being mindful of his role in team fights.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason Ornn is at a disadvantage against Olaf lies in the combination of Olaf's traits and skills. As Olaf's HP decreases, his attack speed and lifesteal increase, allowing him to engage in powerful brawls even when he is near death. Additionally, Olaf can attack while negating crowd control (CC) with his ultimate, making it difficult for Ornn to utilize his CC effectively. Furthermore, Olaf has the mobility to dodge Ornn's skills and can easily read the animation of Ornn's E. Ornn requires preparation to apply CC, and when he takes damage from Olaf, his HP drops quickly, creating a situation that favors Olaf.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to use minions as a shield to avoid Olaf's attacks. Ornn should aim for a knock-up with the E→Q combo while maneuvering to dodge Olaf's axes. Additionally, strengthening coordination with the jungle to create opportunities to catch Olaf with Flash W→R is crucial. In terms of item selection, focusing on toughness and implementing measures against resurrection and healing can enhance Ornn's durability in brawls against Olaf.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has a very high 1v1 power in the early game, especially between levels 1 and 5, where he can aggressively attack Nar. In mini form, Nar has low base stats, making it difficult to withstand Olaf's attacks, which increases the likelihood of losing trades. Additionally, Olaf can attack while negating CC with his R, making Nar's W (Wither) less effective. Furthermore, Olaf becomes stronger as his HP decreases, so even if Nar tries to all-in, he may end up in a worse situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky trades in the early game and safely farm with Q. Choosing a Doran's Shield or tank-oriented items can increase durability, allowing Nar to withstand Olaf's attacks. When Olaf engages, using W to reduce his attack speed and movement speed is crucial for finding an opportunity to escape or counterattack. After level 6, utilizing R to increase durability while charging Q and performing side split pushes can create more opportunities to counter Olaf.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Olaf becomes very powerful after level 6, especially because he can increase his attack power and movement speed while negating CC with his R, making Set's W shield less effective. Additionally, Olaf becomes stronger as his HP decreases, so even if Set engages in a brawl, there is a possibility that Olaf can turn the tables even when he is on the brink of death. Furthermore, Olaf's E slows make it difficult for Set to approach, making him more susceptible to Olaf's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:  \n1. It is important to play aggressively in the early levels and initiate favorable trades before Olaf reaches level 3 or 6.  \n2. Managing the wave effectively to force Olaf to farm under the tower can prevent him from utilizing his strengths.  \n3. Using R after Olaf's R can increase your durability before taking his powerful attacks.  \n4. In terms of item selection, purchasing Bramble early to reduce Olaf's lifesteal is effective. Additionally, acquiring Blade of the Ruined King can give you an advantage in duels against Olaf.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf is very strong in early 1v1 situations, with a slow and ranged damage from his Q, true damage from his E, and the ability to negate CC with his R. Shen becomes weak when pressured by close-range damage, and he finds himself in a tough spot when taking hits from Olaf. It is also important to time your attacks for when Olaf's R is down, but using E after Olaf has used his R is pointless, making it difficult to find the right moment.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Olaf's attacks while prioritizing CS behind the minions in the early laning phase. Use W to block Olaf's auto-attacks and save E's taunt to counterattack when Olaf's R is down. Additionally, coordinating with the jungle to stop Olaf's push can help secure an advantage in lane. In team fights, using R to protect allies while maintaining a frontline is essential.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has a strong ability to aim for a quick finish in the early stages of laning, attacking while weaving in auto-attacks with his Q, which forces Singed to avoid direct confrontations. Additionally, by using his R, Olaf can negate crowd control while increasing his attack power, effectively countering Singed's ability to outlast in fights. Since Singed cannot deal damage unless he stays close, he faces a high risk of taking damage from Olaf, especially against Olaf's passive, which becomes stronger as his HP decreases.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid direct confrontations with Olaf in the early laning phase and to push the minions to proxy farm. Placing wards to secure vision and inviting jungle intervention can help reduce pressure from Olaf. In terms of items, focusing on toughness by choosing boots and adaptive or tank items can ensure sustainability, and it is effective to avoid getting too close to Olaf while his R is active.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf's powerful ultimate skill R can negate the effect of Malphite's R (Unstoppable). Since Olaf can increase his attack power and movement speed while ignoring crowd control, even if Malphite attempts to engage, Olaf can continue attacking without concern. Additionally, Olaf becomes stronger as his HP decreases, making it difficult for Malphite to gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, Olaf's Q provides healing, making it hard for Malphite's harassment to be effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance from Olaf in the early lane phase and conserve E (Shield). When engaging in mini-trades, using the E→AA combo and disengaging immediately is effective to prevent giving Olaf healing from his Q. It is also crucial to place side wards to watch for Olaf's ganks and to avoid isolating yourself. In terms of item build, securing magic resistance and health early on, and choosing juggernaut-type items against AD can enhance durability. In large-scale team fights, focusing on coordination with allies and attempting to engage when Olaf's R is on cooldown is advisable."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire can utilize his healing abilities and area damage effectively in the mid to late game. Olaf has strong damage in the early game, but Bloodmire can avoid Olaf's Q and E using the invulnerability effect of his W, allowing him to deal sustained damage. Additionally, by using Bloodmire's R (Hemoplague), he can aim for both healing and area damage in team fights, giving him an edge over Olaf.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to prioritize CS in the early game while avoiding Olaf's attacks and healing with Q. After level 4, stack E to gain an advantage with Q and use W to negate Olaf's key skills. After level 6, use R to engage Olaf and aim to whittle down multiple enemies with healing and area damage. It's crucial to manage distance and be mindful of splitting and burst damage to avoid Olaf's R.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage against Olaf, especially strong in short trades. Camille's Q deals true damage, allowing her to ignore Olaf's tankiness and deal damage. Additionally, Camille's passive shield helps her withstand Olaf's attacks. Furthermore, Camille can utilize her mobility from E to dodge Olaf's attacks while closing the distance, making it possible to eliminate Olaf with her R.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be cautious of Olaf's early aggression between levels 1 and 3 and not to overcommit. Manage minions to avoid damage from Olaf's Q, and when trading, use the E→Q→AA combo for burst damage. After level 6, the chances to eliminate Olaf increase with Camille's R, so play in a way that forces Olaf to save his R, and activate your own R after he uses his skills to create a favorable situation. Additionally, prioritize items like Trinity Force and Black Cleaver, and choose penetration items for sustain to gain an even greater advantage over Olaf.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has burst damage and a stun in the early game, allowing for strong trades against Olaf. By aiming for a stun with Pantheon's W and following up with Q and auto-attacks, you can chip away at Olaf's HP. Additionally, Pantheon can use his R at level 6 to roam, making it easier to impact other lanes and steer the overall flow of the game in your favor.\n\nTo take advantage, first aim for a stun with W after the lane starts, and use a quick combo (W→Q→AA) to reduce Olaf's HP. Once Olaf's HP is lowered, don't force the attack; instead, disengage and wait for the next opportunity. When you reach level 6, use your R to apply side pressure, allowing you to take control over Olaf. It's also important to be aware of Olaf's R and to focus on short engagements in fights.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas can counter Olaf with long-range harassment and crowd control (CC). Gragas can poke Olaf with his Q and farm safely while maintaining distance with his E. Additionally, when Olaf approaches, Gragas can use his R to knock him back, negating Olaf's attacks while coordinating with allies. Furthermore, it's important to be aware that Olaf's R negates CC, so by timing Gragas's R correctly, you can avoid Olaf's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game, you should harass Olaf with your Q and farm while keeping your distance with your E. When Olaf charges in, it's crucial to use your R to knock him back and retaliate in coordination with your teammates. After level 6, while being cautious of Olaf's R, you can create advantageous situations against him by moving together with your allies. In team fights, Gragas is expected to use his CC to control Olaf while protecting his team's carries.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Olaf is strong in early skirmishes, Tryndamere can negate Olaf's attacks by using his ultimate and can counterattack instead. Additionally, Tryndamere has high HP regeneration, allowing him to sustain fights even while taking damage from Olaf. Furthermore, Olaf's crowd control is only a slow, and Tryndamere can easily avoid Olaf's attacks by closing the distance or escaping with his Spinning Slash.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important not to force trades in the early game but to safely farm minions and avoid Olaf's E. After level 6, instead of saving his ultimate, Tryndamere can create a favorable situation by forcing Olaf to use his ultimate first and then attacking with a full combo. Also, using his ultimate when Olaf attacks allows Tryndamere to deal damage while staying alive.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Olaf poses a threat with his early all-ins and CC immunity from his R, Anbessa can leverage his high mobility and sustained damage to turn the tables. All of Anbessa's skills come with a dash, allowing him to attack while avoiding Olaf's attacks and maintaining distance. Additionally, using Anbessa's R after Olaf's R has expired makes it easier to neutralize Olaf.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to manage minions with Q and E in the early game while charging the passive and avoiding Olaf's Q. Using W to absorb damage and avoiding prolonged engagements before drawing out Olaf's R is effective. In the mid-game, it's beneficial to conserve W while engaging in short trades favorably, using Anbessa's R after Olaf's R to suppress him and ensure Olaf goes down. In the late game, it's crucial to dive into the backline during team fights with R, utilizing E and the passive to maximize sustained damage.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control (CC), and especially in all-out situations, his attack power and mobility increase. If he can avoid Olaf's attacks, K'Sante can negate Olaf's damage while utilizing his inherent durability and shields to fight. Additionally, K'Sante does not have the ability to negate Olaf's CC, allowing him to use Olaf's ultimate to avoid attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to prioritize survival in the lane and avoid Olaf's attacks. Purchasing Ninja Tabi can help reduce Olaf's damage, increasing K'Sante's durability. It is also effective to time attacks based on Olaf's cooldowns, dealing damage with Q and W while using E to create distance. Furthermore, leveraging jungle ganks to apply pressure on Olaf can help secure lane dominance. In team fights, K'Sante can use his CC to protect allies while negating Olaf's attacks, allowing the team to gain an advantage in combat.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has a wide range of hard crowd control and high sustained damage output, making him strong against Olaf. Olaf's CC immunity from \"Ragnarok\" is effective in avoiding Aatrox's \"Q\" and \"E,\" but Aatrox can use his skills at the right timing to dodge Olaf's attacks while dealing damage. Additionally, Aatrox's passive healing effect allows him to maintain durability in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Aatrox to be aware of the cooldown of Olaf's \"Ragnarok\" and to engage during that time. While Olaf is using \"Ragnarok,\" Aatrox should conserve his skills and aim to land \"Q\" and \"E\" when Olaf is vulnerable, allowing him to deal sustained damage while healing. Furthermore, when taking damage from Olaf, using Aatrox's \"W\" to reduce damage and create opportunities for counterattacks is effective.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank can maintain distance while fighting against Olaf in the early lane phase. He can create zones with his E (Barrel) to avoid Olaf's attacks while securing CS. Additionally, he can continuously harass while healing with his W, reducing the risk of taking damage from Olaf. Furthermore, Gangplank's R is an infinite range damage skill, making it easy to assist in team fights and other lanes, allowing him to maneuver advantageously when Olaf charges in.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, use E (Barrel) to keep distance from Olaf while securing CS and harassing. When Olaf approaches, heal with W to maintain durability. Once in the mid-game, utilize R to increase damage output in team fights and coordinate with allies to pressure Olaf. In objective fights, use barrels to buy time while securing vision and preventing Olaf from diving in. Avoid 1v1 situations and aim for dispersed fights to maximize Gangplank's strengths.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has a CC skill (Counter Strike) that can negate Olaf's attacks, allowing him to effectively counterattack, especially when Olaf's attack speed and lifesteal are high. Additionally, by avoiding Olaf's axe (Q) with its slow effect, Jax can maintain distance in fights, thereby neutralizing Olaf's strengths. Furthermore, Jax has an attack speed buff, which allows him to deal high DPS in skirmishes, giving him an edge even when Olaf becomes stronger as his HP decreases.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to create a zone to prevent Olaf from picking up his axe again after he throws it, maintaining distance. It's a good idea to actively trade when Olaf misses his axe. Before level 6, Jax can trade strongly against Olaf, so having a sheen and a longsword will give him even more of an advantage. In the late game, purchasing Zhonya's can help Jax avoid Olaf's ultimate (R), allowing him to gain an advantage in one-on-one situations. Playing confidently and skillfully dodging Olaf's abilities is key.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled excels in short skirmishes and has the ability to counter Olaf's sustained fights. While Olaf can use his R to negate crowd control and deal powerful attacks, Kled can chip away at Olaf's HP with a short auto-attack combo (W→AA→E) during that time. Additionally, Kled's passive health return increases his durability in tight battles, allowing him to withstand Olaf's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid Olaf's Q during the laning phase. Getting hit by Olaf's axe puts you at a disadvantage, so you need to maintain distance and poke him carefully. If Skaarl is separated, it's crucial not to force engagements and prioritize farming. From mid-game to team fights, prioritize roaming from the side, create distance after Olaf uses his R, and coordinate with your teammates' crowd control to fight effectively. Timing your engage when Olaf's R is down can also be effective.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has sustained area damage and can easily prevent Olaf from closing in. Specifically, by applying a slow with E as Olaf approaches, Rumble can deal damage before taking hits from Olaf. Additionally, Rumble's R provides continuous damage and a slow to enemies within the area, allowing for effective counterplay when Olaf charges in. Furthermore, by managing heat, Rumble can frequently use skills, applying constant pressure on Olaf.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning, push the minions while gaining heat with Q, and use E to slow Olaf as he approaches. When Olaf uses Q, use W for a shield to mitigate damage while looking for a chance to counterattack. After level 6, save R and use it the moment Olaf charges in to zone him, coordinating with allies to deal damage. Also, prioritize durability and ability power in item selection to ensure sustained damage output. This makes it easier to maintain an advantageous situation against Olaf.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo is strong in prolonged fights and can withstand Olaf's short-term attacks due to his ultimate ability that provides significant healing. Olaf actively throws his Q to deal damage in the early game and initiates short trades with his E, but Dr. Mundo has high durability and can focus on farming while using health potions to withstand Olaf's attacks. Additionally, even while taking damage from Olaf, Dr. Mundo can leverage his self-healing abilities to turn the fight into a war of attrition, gradually creating a favorable situation while absorbing Olaf's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to focus on farming while enduring in the early lane and to avoid Olaf's Q. If hit, immediately use your Q to create distance and avoid Olaf's slow effect. The key is to lure Olaf into a prolonged fight after he deals self-damage with his E, avoiding a quick resolution. Once you reach level 6, conserve your R and use it in conjunction with Olaf's R or his engage to maximize your healing. Additionally, be wary of healing reduction items (like Executioner's) and adjust your MR or defenses as needed to maintain an advantage over Olaf.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has a silence with his Q, which can shut down Olaf's abilities. This allows Garen to deal damage with short bursts before Olaf can utilize his sustain and damage output. Additionally, Garen has high durability and healing capabilities, making him favorable in trades against Olaf. Furthermore, even considering Olaf's invulnerability from his R, Garen can create distance during that time, allowing him to fight while minimizing risk.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Garen can use minions to poke Olaf with a Q → AA → E combo. When Olaf uses his R, it's important to avoid prolonged fights and create distance. Also, by timing attacks when Olaf's Q is on cooldown, Garen can maximize the effectiveness of his silence. In team fights, Garen can deal significant damage with his R while being mindful of disengaging when necessary, allowing him to lead the fight in a favorable direction."

      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe main reasons for this are Shen's E ability for closing the gap and the presence of his global R. Shen can close the distance with his E and apply a taunt, making it easier to negate Cho'Gath's skills. Additionally, Shen's W can absorb Cho'Gath's burst damage, making trades unfavorable. Furthermore, Shen has high durability as a tank and possesses the ability to assist allies in team fights, making it difficult for Cho'Gath to gain an advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to push the minions too much in the early game and to time your Q to hit when Shen uses his E. You should also use your W to absorb Shen's attacks while securing CS. In team fights, while Shen is taking focus at the front, Cho'Gath should aim to deal damage from the back using his R. By securing vision and waiting for jungle intervention, you can create favorable situations against Shen.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has skills that can negate auto-attacks, which can reduce Camille's damage output. In particular, Shen's E taunt can disrupt Camille's attacks, making it difficult for her to utilize her mobility. Additionally, Shen's R provides an infinite range shield, which increases the likelihood of intervention to protect allies when Camille targets a single enemy, making it harder for her to unleash her burst damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS in the early lane phase and avoid unnecessary trades. After provoking Shen's E, Camille can use her E to create distance, allowing her to avoid the taunt while engaging. Furthermore, after level 6, utilizing her R to aim for a quick resolution can create situations where Shen's R has less impact. Additionally, considering defensive items in the build to counter Shen's true damage should also be taken into account.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has high harassment ability from the early game and can put pressure on Nasus through his Q attacks. Additionally, Shen's E (Taunt) restricts Nasus's movements, making it difficult for him to approach. Furthermore, Shen's R (Teleport) provides global support, which can hinder Nasus's ability to farm in lane. Nasus is very weak in the early game, and when he takes damage from Shen, it becomes hard for him to farm and stack his Q.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play carefully in the early game and position yourself to avoid harassment from Shen's Q. Freezing the minions near the tower creates a situation where Shen finds it difficult to attack, making it easier to secure farm. Additionally, using W (Wither) to limit Shen's movements can also be effective in increasing your chances of winning one-on-one encounters. When Shen roams, it is crucial to continue stacking minions with your Q and prepare for the late game.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen is a tank-oriented champion, and he is strong in prolonged fights due to his W, which can negate auto-attacks, his passive shield, and his E, which provokes enemies. Shen's R can support allies from an infinite range, making it easier for him to intervene when Yone tries to engage, thus making it harder for Yone to utilize his burst damage. Additionally, Shen has strong traits against diver-type champions that rely on auto-attacks, creating a situation where Yone's attacks are less effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary face-to-face confrontations in the early lane phase, focusing on farming with Q while looking for one-trade opportunities with E. After level 6, Shen's R becomes powerful, so timing your aggression for when Shen's R is on cooldown is effective. Additionally, after provoking Shen's E, you can aim for a knock-up with Q3 followed by E, and then attack all at once after forcing Shen to use his W, creating an opportunity to capitalize on your burst damage. Keeping Flash available ensures you have a way to dodge Shen's attacks, and using Ignite can also apply kill pressure effectively.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen's E taunt and R infinite range shield limit Malphite's engage potential. Shen has strong traits against divers and skirmishers that rely on auto-attacks, and especially against champions like Malphite that depend on physical damage, he can use his shield to withstand trades. Additionally, although Shen has low push potential in lane, he can secure CS by processing minions with Malphite's Q while avoiding attacks with his E.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Play cautiously until level 6, focusing on avoiding Shen's E, especially positioning to not get taunted.\n2. Save Flash to coordinate with allies for a counter when Shen's R is activated.\n3. Build more tanky, choosing items like Frozen Heart or Sunfire to increase durability and better absorb Shen's damage.\n4. Place wards effectively and enhance map awareness to act in accordance with allies, reducing opportunities for Shen to capitalize on his R.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has a global ultimate and can enhance the team's survivability by granting shields to allies. This means that even if Renekton gains an advantage in lane, Shen's ultimate can potentially negate that advantage. Additionally, Shen is strong against auto-attack reliant dive champions, allowing him to deflect Renekton's attacks, making one-on-one trades difficult. Furthermore, since Shen lacks sustained healing, the risk of being countered after Renekton deals damage increases.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Renekton to apply pressure on Shen before level 6. Engaging in trades before reaching level 6 and forcing Shen to conserve his E can prevent him from escaping. Additionally, avoiding Shen's W can reduce trading opportunities, allowing Renekton to gain an advantage in lane after Shen uses his ultimate. Utilizing Demolish to secure tower plates after Shen has used his ultimate can also be effective.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has E (Taunt), which can disrupt Warwick's attacks. Especially when Shen's W (Shield) is active, Warwick's auto-attacks are less effective, making it difficult to deal damage. Additionally, Shen's R (Teleport) provides strong support capabilities, and when Warwick targets isolated enemies, Shen's intervention can complicate the situation. Furthermore, Shen has high durability in team fights, and since Warwick's damage often relies on his allies, he can feel disadvantaged in team fights as well.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS (Creep Score) and secure farm in the lane. By attacking when Shen's E is on cooldown, you can increase your chances of dealing damage. Also, while Shen's W is active, try to maintain distance and focus on dealing damage with Q and skills. In team fights, instead of targeting isolated enemies, you can fight effectively by coordinating with your allies before Shen's R activates.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has high tank performance and can negate Anbessa's dash with his E's taunt. This makes it difficult for Anbessa to avoid Shen's attacks, making him more susceptible to damage. Additionally, Shen's R provides strong protection for allies, which can effectively block Anbessa's attacks during team fights and side lane interventions. Furthermore, Shen has skills that can negate auto-attacks, making Anbessa's enhanced auto-attacks less effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, it is crucial to predict Shen's E and evade it with sidesteps or dashes. This increases the chances of avoiding the taunt and creating opportunities to attack. Additionally, using the W shield at the right timing can effectively reduce damage when taking hits from Shen. Moreover, while being mindful of farming in the lane, it is important to use minions to maintain distance from Shen and avoid unnecessary 1v1 situations. In team fights, being aware of Shen's R and timing attacks on the backline can help minimize Shen's impact.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has tank characteristics and is particularly strong against champions that rely on auto-attacks. Shen's E taunt restricts Irelia's movement and takes away her advantage in close combat. Additionally, Shen's R shield reduces Irelia's damage and diminishes its effectiveness in team fights and all-ins. Furthermore, Shen has low pushing power in lane, making it easier for Irelia to farm CS, while Shen's tankiness increases his influence in the late game, making it difficult for Irelia to counter him in the late game.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, safe play in the early game is crucial. Purchasing a Doran's Blade and starting with E to push the wave to your tower allows you to avoid trades with Shen while farming CS. Using minions to avoid Shen's taunt and waiting for the cooldown of Q before going all-in is effective. Utilizing lifesteal and taking your time in trades is also important. Being on the side where Shen's Spirit Blade is not flying and creating advantageous situations before Shen's items come online is key to victory.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has tank characteristics and is strong against divers and skirmishers who rely on auto-attacks. Shen's E provocation nullifies Quinn's attacks and provides an opportunity for counterattacks. Additionally, Shen's W shield reduces Quinn's burst damage, making it difficult to deal sustained damage. Furthermore, Shen has low pushing power in lane, so even if Quinn can push under the tower, Shen's ability to support allies with his Ult gives him overall high influence.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be noted:\n1. Avoid attacking within Shen's W protection zone and be careful not to draw minion aggro.\n2. When Shen disappears from sight, be wary of his Ult preparation and use W to reveal him.\n3. Take advantage of Shen's skill cooldowns to harass during his downtime.\n4. Utilize Shen's low pushing power to push under the tower and deny CS, applying pressure to other lanes.\n5. After being provoked by Shen, use a dash to escape and look for a chance to counterattack.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can turn the matchup against Shen in your favor.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen can use his E taunt to gain an advantage in short-term fights and can block Mundo's auto-attacks with his W. Additionally, Shen's R provides side lane support, which can make Mundo's presence in team fights less impactful. Furthermore, Shen is strong against sustained damage and can outpace Mundo's self-healing ability, making long fights unfavorable for him.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to harass with Q in the early game while being cautious of Shen's E and using W to reduce damage taken. Timing counterattacks with enhanced AA after E and saving R for ambushes or counters can help turn the matchup in Mundo's favor. Additionally, building items focused on durability can increase survivability and allow for more favorable engagements against Shen.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen is a melee tank and can catch Teemo with his E (Taunt). When Shen's E hits, Teemo is restricted in his actions and becomes more susceptible to Shen's attacks. Additionally, Shen's R (shield for allies) makes it difficult for Teemo to take down Shen. Furthermore, Shen has skills that enhance auto-attacks or negate them, making it easier to nullify Teemo's attacks, which is particularly tough for Teemo who relies heavily on auto-attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, it is effective to attack when Shen's E is on cooldown. Also, securing vision and placing mushrooms can limit Shen's movements and make it easier to poke. Moreover, in terms of item selection, choosing items that emphasize sustain can increase durability in trades against Shen. Finally, avoiding isolation and receiving support from allies can help turn the matchup against Shen in your favor.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble's attacks can be easily disrupted by Shen's E (Taunt), and especially in close combat, Shen's W (Defense) makes it difficult for Rumble to deal damage. Additionally, after level 6, Shen has the ability to use his R (Teleport) to protect allies, increasing his influence in team fights, making it harder for Rumble to deal with that pressure. Furthermore, Shen has strong traits against AA-dependent diver champions, which can create situations where Rumble's sustained magic damage is not effectively utilized.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid close combat with Shen in the early lane phase and use Q to harass over minions. Utilizing minions to bait Shen's E and timing counterattacks when he is vulnerable is essential. Choosing Mercury's Treads as an item can reduce the impact of the taunt, and building items like Liandry's or Rylai's can enhance sustained damage. After level 6, using R for zoning while avoiding Shen's taunt and contributing to team fights is crucial.",
      "ナー": "Gnar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has a taunt (E), which can restrict Gnar's actions when he tries to all-in. Additionally, Shen can support his allies with an infinite range shield from his ultimate (R), making it difficult for Gnar to create advantageous situations. Furthermore, Shen has strong traits against auto-attack reliant diver champions, making it hard for Gnar to all-in in his mini form.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, utilize mini Gnar to harass from a distance and maneuver to avoid Shen's E.\n2. Carefully manage the timing of transforming into Mega Gnar to attack outside of Shen's taunt range.\n3. When Shen roams, immediately push the lane to chip away at the tower, reducing Shen's influence.\n4. In item selection, it is important to prioritize mobility and choose equipment that avoids direct confrontations with Shen."
    },
    "loses": {
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has high mobility in short trades and can avoid Shen's E (Shadow Dash), making it easier to engage. Additionally, by using Gwen's W (Hallowed Mist), she can avoid Shen's attacks while dealing damage. Furthermore, Gwen has percentage damage and true damage, allowing her to effectively deal damage to Shen, who is a tank.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, it is important to focus on farming without forcing the use of E, while safely poking Shen with Q. When Shen's E is used, avoid it with W and keep an eye on the map for potential roams from Shen's R (Ally Shield & TP). After level 6, use R (Gwen) after Shen uses E or when his W is on cooldown, and engage while managing distance with repeated Qs. In team fights, using W to reduce damage taken and targeting important enemies with R is effective.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has a high ability to deal sustained poison damage, allowing him to gain an edge in prolonged fights against Shen's tankiness. Additionally, Singed can fling Shen back with his E, making it easier to avoid close combat and Shen's taunt. Furthermore, Singed has high movement speed, which enables him to apply pressure on Shen through proxy farming.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, you should harass from a distance with Q and create distance using E when Shen steps forward. If Shen is freezing the minions, secure vision while aiming for proxy farming and roam to influence other lanes. In trades, use the E→Q combo to chip away at Shen's durability while increasing your own survivability with R to retreat safely. In team fights, it is crucial to utilize Singed's sustained damage to pin down the enemy tank, making it easier for your backline to deal damage.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox is a fighter with powerful healing abilities and high damage, particularly excelling in consecutive attacks. While Shen has high tankiness, Aatrox's reset-based combo often surpasses Shen's durability, making it easier to deal damage by exploiting the openings after Shen uses his skills. Additionally, Aatrox's knock-up skill can restrict Shen's actions, contributing to a favorable combat situation.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Aatrox to maneuver to avoid Shen's skills. Specifically, timing attacks after Shen uses his skills or before his global support from R activates is crucial. Dealing damage with Q while utilizing W for healing allows for sustained fighting. Furthermore, using E to stick to the enemy makes it harder to receive Shen's counterattacks, allowing for increased damage output. It is also important to use R to increase movement speed and deal significant damage before Shen can escape.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high 1v1 performance and excels in sustain and burst damage. Particularly, with his ultimate, he becomes immortal for 5 seconds, allowing him to survive Shen's attacks. Additionally, Tryndamere can enhance his critical strikes by building Fury, enabling him to deal high damage while ignoring Shen's tankiness. Although Shen has a taunt with his E and can negate auto-attacks with his W, Tryndamere can avoid these while still attacking, making it easier to maintain an advantage in the matchup.\n\nTo gain an advantage, focus on CS in the early lane phase, ensuring recovery with Q while avoiding unnecessary engages. It's important to use the minions as cover to avoid Shen's E and build Tryndamere's Fury. After level 6, utilize your ultimate to avoid reckless plays while being mindful of Shen's R, positioning with E to attack from outside the zone of W. In the mid to late game, leverage split pushing, and during team fights, use your R to engage, retreating or regrouping before being targeted, maximizing Tryndamere's strengths.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Kail becomes Ranged and can deal powerful DPS, allowing for sustained harassment against Shen. Shen primarily relies on melee attacks, and by using Kail's skills with slow effects, she can deal damage while avoiding Shen's attacks. Additionally, Kail's invulnerability from her R is very effective for avoiding Shen's taunt from his E.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid Shen's attacks while farming with Q and harassing with W until reaching level 6. After level 6, Kail becomes Ranged and can safely attack Shen. After Shen uses his E, it is a good opportunity to engage, taking advantage of the cooldown of his skills. Furthermore, managing the wave to create a situation where Shen has difficulty farming under the tower can help create a CS lead. It is also important to time Shen's Ult and coordinate with teammates to gain an advantage in team fights.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has high single-target damage, and especially when mounted on Skaarl, he excels in short skirmishes. By timing his attacks to dodge Shen's taunt and shield, Kled can effectively engage Shen. Additionally, Kled is good at clearing minions, making it easier to manage the lane and apply pressure on Shen.\n\nTo take advantage, Kled should prioritize aggression in the early lane phase, using Shen's taunt cooldown to initiate attacks. When mounted on Skaarl, he can deal damage with Q while using W to charge at Shen, applying pressure. At level 6, Kled can use his R to force an engage and aim for a kill before Shen can retaliate. It is also important for Kled to time his attacks when Shen uses his R to support allies, taking advantage of that window. In team fights, Kled can look for 1v1 opportunities in the side lanes, creating advantageous situations by avoiding Shen's intervention.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire can avoid Shen's taunt (E) with W (Sanguine Pool), which helps mitigate Shen's burst damage. Additionally, Bloodmire has healing capabilities through Q (Blood Sense), making it easier to maintain his HP while dealing sustained damage. Furthermore, after level 6, he can leverage the powerful damage and sustain from R (Blood Altar) to gain an advantage over Shen.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, use Q to farm minions while healing and engage in mini trades. It's important to be aware of Shen's E cooldown and to attack when E is unavailable. If taunted, become invulnerable with W and look for a chance to counterattack. Once you reach level 6, utilize R to be cautious of Shen's roams while pushing and limiting the opponent's movements. In team fights, contribute to the team by dealing AOE damage from the backline while being mindful of Shen's R and taunt.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce excels at poking from a distance and can use the E→Q combo to chip away at Shen's HP. Shen is vulnerable to ranged attacks in the early game and has limited means to counter Jayce's high burst damage. Additionally, Jayce can maintain distance while managing minions, allowing him to avoid Shen's E (Taunt) and consistently deal damage.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, chip away at Shen's HP with E→Q while using minions to maintain a favorable position. It's important to time your distance when Shen tries to land a taunt. After level 3, if Shen feels the damage difference, it's effective to roam instead of chasing him down, applying pressure in other lanes. After level 6, you can maximize Jayce's advantage by dealing damage first in team fights and maneuvering to avoid Shen's tankiness.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has very strong 1v1 potential after level 6, and he is likely to win even during Shen's ultimate. Mordekaiser's R can trap the enemy in the realm of death, nullifying Shen's shield and support abilities, creating a 1v1 situation. Additionally, Mordekaiser has a passive that deals sustained damage, allowing him to surpass Shen's tankiness.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, it is important to trade aggressively before Shen reaches level 6, dealing damage while avoiding his skills. Specifically, you can use Mordekaiser's Q to hit minions and deal damage, utilize W for shielding, and approach with E to trade effectively. When Shen oversteps, you can close the gap with E, deal damage with Q and W, and force a 1v1 with R to fight advantageously. Furthermore, purchasing Adaptive Helm and Ninja Tabi early can help mitigate Shen's damage while allowing you to deal sustained damage.",
      "セト": "Sett has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett can engage in powerful brawls against Shen after level 6. While Shen is strong at early levels, Sett's ability to deal sustained damage increases as he levels up, especially by utilizing the shield from his W and the empowered attacks from his Q to trade favorably. Even if Shen's attacks are strong, Sett can retaliate with auto-attacks and aim for the cooldown of his shield, allowing him to leverage his durability in fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to play cautiously between levels 1 and 5, avoiding Shen's Q burst damage. If you have Bone Plating, you can use it to trade favorably in early skirmishes. After level 6, you can use Sett's R to close the gap and deal significant damage to Shen while forcing trades. Additionally, if Shen escapes with his ultimate, you can look for opportunities to destroy towers, making it effective to apply pressure actively.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick excels at minion management and can easily apply pressure in the lane. In particular, by creating walls with his W, he can effectively block Shen's E taunt, reducing Shen's opportunities to retaliate. Additionally, Shen has low pushing power, so Yorick can push the minions to gain an advantage in the lane. Furthermore, after level 6, Yorick can summon the Maiden, significantly increasing his combat power and applying strong pressure against Shen.\n\nTo take advantage, first push the minions at the start and poke Shen with Q and ghouls. If Shen closes the distance with his W, create a wall with your W to block the taunt or trap Shen, creating a favorable situation. If Shen uses his R to escape, it's important not to chase him recklessly but to apply tower pressure. After level 6, using the Maiden and ghouls to catch him quickly is crucial. Additionally, when the jungle comes, using W to seal off the fight and dragging it into a long battle can give you an advantage over Shen.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has range and can deal consistent damage to Shen using skills with percentage damage. Additionally, after catching Shen with Urgot's E, he can use his R to secure kills, allowing him to deal damage while ignoring Shen's tankiness. Furthermore, Urgot's laning phase from levels 1 to 3 is very strong, making it easier to create advantageous situations by clearing minions before Shen uses his E.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to manage the wave in the early lane phase and poke Shen from out of range with Q. Look for the timing when Shen's E (Taunt) is on cooldown to engage with the E→Q→melee auto combo. After level 6, aim for guaranteed kill opportunities with R while being cautious of Shen's R intervention, and try to isolate enemies to execute them with R. Also, pushing the enemy under tower makes it easier for Shen to intervene with his R, so be careful not to push minions too hard, and ensure vision while keeping an eye on enemy jungle roams."

  "パンテオン": {
    "name": "パンテオン",
    "beats": {
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon is extremely powerful in early duels, especially by aiming for a flash stun between levels 2 and 3, which puts significant pressure on Warwick. With Pantheon's targeted leap and stun, Warwick becomes vulnerable to attacks, making it difficult to utilize his healing effect, especially when his HP is low. Additionally, Pantheon has a global ultimate, which increases his influence on other lanes and creates situations where Warwick is likely to become isolated.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to secure vision and always keep track of Pantheon's movements. Particularly when Pantheon is looking to gank, it is important to play safely in coordination with teammates. As Warwick levels up, his healing ability becomes stronger, so after level 6, it is effective to use his ultimate to avoid one-on-one situations with Pantheon while fighting alongside teammates. Furthermore, by cleverly adjusting his build to enhance survivability, Warwick can withstand Pantheon's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has strong burst damage before level 6 and can play favorably against Mordekaiser during all-ins. Pantheon's attacks, utilizing his leap and stun, are very effective at whittling down Mordekaiser's durability. Additionally, Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and since the cooldown of his only gap-closing ability, E, is long, it becomes difficult to avoid Pantheon's attacks. Furthermore, Pantheon can easily capitalize on early ganks and pressure, making it hard for Mordekaiser to farm.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Early Durability**: It is important to use W (Indestructible) to absorb Pantheon's attacks while farming. This will help maintain your health.\n\n2. **Utilization After Level 6**: Once you reach level 6, you can use R (Realm of Death) to engage in a favorable 1v1 against Pantheon. This allows you to isolate Pantheon and create a more advantageous situation.\n\n3. **Item Selection**: Prioritize purchasing Riftmaker or Liandry's Anguish to enhance your sustained damage, increasing your ability to counter Pantheon. Additionally, choosing items that boost your durability will make it easier to withstand Pantheon's burst damage.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can mitigate Mordekaiser's disadvantages and create a more favorable situation.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon is very strong in close-range skirmishes, especially excelling at all-ins at level 2. Pantheon can close the distance using his Q and E, and deal guaranteed damage with his W stun. Teemo can neutralize Pantheon's auto-attacks with his Q's blind effect, but he cannot withstand Pantheon's burst damage, making it difficult to harass, especially before level 2. Additionally, after level 6, Pantheon can easily roam with his R, impacting other lanes, which makes it hard for Teemo to deal with that pressure.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Teemo to place mushrooms in the bushes to secure vision and deter Pantheon's approach. He should also use his Q to disrupt Pantheon's auto-attacks and maintain distance while harassing. Buying boots early to prepare for a potential all-in at level 2 is also effective. Furthermore, being cautious of Pantheon's R and timing his actions accordingly can help reduce the pressure from the matchup.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon excels at early short trades and can deal significant damage to Olaf with burst damage following a stun from his W. Particularly, when Pantheon uses his E (shield), it makes it difficult for Olaf to land his attacks, causing him to struggle to deal damage. Additionally, Pantheon has a strong combo at level 2, and while Olaf is farming, Pantheon will actively engage, putting Olaf at a disadvantage in early trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm quietly in the early lane and avoid Pantheon's attacks. Specifically, timing your attacks after Pantheon uses his W and creating distance with your Q can be effective. Also, utilizing the healing from your W while ensuring your E lands can help chip away at Pantheon's HP. Furthermore, after level 6, it is crucial to use your R to negate crowd control and focus on gaining an advantage in team fights or 1v1s.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon is very strong in trades until level 6, especially with the all-in after using his E, which is a threat. Pantheon's Q has a long range, making it difficult for Gwen to maintain distance, and she is prone to taking damage in early pokes and trades. Additionally, Pantheon excels at burst damage in a short time, and since Gwen has limited sustain, she can easily fall behind in prolonged damage exchanges. Furthermore, Pantheon has a powerful stun in team fights, making it hard for Gwen to utilize her survivability in the mist.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid trading with Pantheon until level 6 and focus on farming. You can gain an advantage in trades by attacking after he uses his E. Choosing D Shield and Second Wind can help reduce early poke, and considering an AP Omnivamp or burst build in your itemization can be effective. After level 6, you can gain an advantage over Pantheon by dashing in to attack after he uses his E.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has a powerful all-in ability from the early game. Especially between levels 1 and 3, Pantheon can easily initiate short trades using his leap skill with a stun, and Rumble takes significant damage from those attacks. Additionally, Pantheon can deal burst damage instantly, making it difficult for Rumble to retaliate if he cannot manage his heat gauge, as overheating leads to silence. Furthermore, Pantheon has a global ultimate, which increases his influence on other lanes, making it hard for Rumble to deal with that pressure.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming and play defensively in the early game, safely poking from behind minions. Utilizing W (Shield) to reduce damage taken and blocking Pantheon's charges with allies' towers or minions is effective. After level 6, using R (Ultimate) to dominate team fights and either isolate Pantheon from the lane or force him to use his ultimate before coordinating with allies is beneficial. It is also crucial to use wards to monitor side roaming and to avoid overextending when Pantheon is visible.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Pantheon's early strength and burst damage. Pantheon has a very powerful combo at level 2, forcing Singed to play defensively in trades. Additionally, Pantheon can all-in with his E for a stun and W for a leap, making it difficult for Singed to approach, and he takes significant damage if he gets burst down. Furthermore, Singed lacks ranged attack options, making it hard to avoid Pantheon's attacks, and there is a risk of being whittled down before being able to engage in a prolonged fight.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play defensively in the early laning phase and avoid Pantheon's trades. Utilizing minions to farm with Q while placing W in the direction of the enemy's engage to block E can be effective. Additionally, saving your fling (E) for AA cancels or to leave the enemy behind, and using R to heal when receiving a stun or burst is crucial. Building armor and HP items early can enhance safety, and when proxy farming, it is important to check the enemy jungle situation and coordinate with teammates.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has a very strong all-in ability in the early game. Pantheon excels at level 2 and 3 engages, using his E with a stun to initiate powerful trades against Nasus. Nasus is very weak in the early game and needs to position himself behind minions to farm, but he can easily take damage from Pantheon's attacks. Additionally, Nasus only has a slow as a means of approach and is highly reliant on auto-attacks, making it difficult to counter Pantheon's burst damage. Furthermore, Pantheon can reduce Nasus's opportunities to stack his Q by applying pressure in the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Utilize freezing**: It is important to freeze the minions on your side to safely accumulate CS while avoiding Pantheon's attacks.\n2. **Use Wither appropriately**: When Pantheon approaches with his E, you can use Wither to limit his movement and buy time to escape.\n3. **Utilize TP**: Use Teleport to influence side lanes and apply pressure in other lanes, which can help Nasus grow.\n4. **Adjust item build**: By choosing tank builds or items that provide lifesteal, you can increase your durability and improve your survival rate in team fights.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon is very strong from levels 1 to 3, and it becomes particularly difficult if he gets the jump on you. Pantheon's skill combo can deal burst damage in a short amount of time, and since Kail has low durability in the early game, she can take significant damage if all-inned. Additionally, Kail continues to face a tough situation as a melee champion until she reaches level 6, making her susceptible to Pantheon's attacks. Furthermore, Pantheon's ultimate affects other lanes, reducing Kail's opportunities to farm waves.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is recommended that Kail chooses defensive runes (like Bone Plating and Second Wind) and starts with a Doran's Shield. This will help her withstand Pantheon's attacks a bit better and promote her growth towards level 6. Additionally, purchasing Banshee's Veil at level 16 increases her chances of countering Pantheon. Moreover, it is important to be mindful of wave control and to aggressively farm CS when Pantheon's ultimate is used in other lanes.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has high burst damage in the early game and excels at all-ins in a short time. Especially between levels 1 and 5, Pantheon can easily initiate short trades and force Shen to use his E (Taunt) and W (Shield) cooldowns. While Shen is durable, he can quickly run out of steam when taking damage from Pantheon, and since his damage output relies on tanking, he becomes disadvantaged in prolonged fights. Additionally, Pantheon’s R (Global Ultimate) roaming ability is a threat, as it can easily impact other lanes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm safely behind minions in the early game and avoid Pantheon’s attacks. Using E (Taunt) at the right moment to counter Pantheon’s attacks can help turn trades in your favor. Furthermore, after level 6, utilizing R (Ultimate) to support allies in other lanes can influence the overall match. Additionally, creatively building to increase durability can also be effective in withstanding Pantheon’s burst damage.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is Pantheon’s powerful all-in capability and crowd control effects from his stun. Pantheon has a targeted leap and stun, making it risky for Quinn to engage as she is likely to be countered. Additionally, Pantheon has a high burst damage potential early on, and since Quinn lacks sustain, she can easily find herself in a tough situation when taking damage from Pantheon. Furthermore, it is important to understand Pantheon’s skill cooldowns and identify opportunities to attack, but Quinn is vulnerable to damage during this time.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is crucial to consider the following points. First, Quinn should adopt a \"counter-aggressive\" playstyle rather than a defensive one. It is important to counter Pantheon’s attacks while looking for opportunities to retaliate. Also, choosing \"Long Sword\" and \"3 Potions\" as starting items will help secure damage and sustain. At level 1, Quinn can fight Pantheon evenly, so waiting in the bush and attacking with \"Harrier > E > Harrier\" when Pantheon appears is effective. Additionally, be careful not to let Pantheon land his Q for free, and it is important to get close to Pantheon when attacking. Finally, by understanding Pantheon’s skill cooldowns and identifying opportunities to attack, Quinn can leverage her strength in the late game.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has powerful short-term burst damage and a stun in the early game, making trades favorable for him, especially between levels 1 and 3. By using Pantheon's E (Defensive Stance), he can negate Riven's attacks while gaining an opportunity to counterattack. Additionally, Riven has many mobility skills, so getting hit by Pantheon's stun can leave her unable to do anything. Furthermore, Riven lacks sustain, making it difficult to counter Pantheon's burst damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, during levels 1 to 3, avoid forcing trades and instead maneuver to make Pantheon use his W (Shield Vault) or E. Attacking over minions with Q and then countering with a short combo after forcing him to use his skills can be effective. Also, after level 3, aim to flank from the side to target E's cooldown and deal damage with a full combo using R. By securing vision and coordinating with the jungle, you can leverage Riven's strengths while alleviating the disadvantage.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has high damage output from the early game, especially capable of powerful all-ins between levels 1 and 3. Pantheon's W stun can interrupt Garen's Q, taking away Garen's opportunity to retaliate. Additionally, Pantheon can mitigate damage with his E while deflecting Garen's attacks, making Garen more likely to be at a disadvantage in short trades. Furthermore, Pantheon has a global R, which increases his influence on other lanes, making it difficult for Garen to gain an advantage in his lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to first purchase a Doran's Shield and choose tank-oriented items to increase durability. Also, using Flash or Ignite to avoid Pantheon's attacks while timing Garen's Q for silence can be effective for engaging in short skirmishes. Particularly, attacking during Pantheon's cooldowns after he uses W or E can create opportunities to gain an advantage. After level 6, consider using R to secure kills reliably."

      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in lane. In particular, he can deal damage using barrels while avoiding Pantheon's attacks. Additionally, while Pantheon has a strong all-in, Gangplank can cleanse crowd control and heal with his W, making him durable enough to mitigate Pantheon's attacks. Furthermore, Pantheon lacks AoE damage and struggles in team fights, allowing Gangplank to maneuver advantageously.\n\nTo take advantage, play cautiously at first and aim to deplete Pantheon's mana pool. Focus on last-hitting without taking damage, prioritizing experience while avoiding death. After level 6, it's important to be aware of Pantheon's ultimate and target minions or tower plates after he uses it. Also, trading after Pantheon uses his Q and attacking when his passive is down can give you a better edge. Utilizing ganks is also effective, as Pantheon tends to play aggressively, allowing you to gain an advantage with the support of your jungler.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has strong 1v1 scaling, and by using her W (Parry) to negate Pantheon’s CC, she can deflect the opponent's burst damage while counterattacking. Additionally, Fiora's passive provides extra damage and healing, making her very effective against tank champions and allowing her to counter Pantheon’s short-term kill potential. While Pantheon is strong in the early game, Fiora can take advantage in the mid to late game.\n\nTo gain the advantage, start by avoiding Q and dashes behind the minions at the beginning of the lane, and sustain with Doran's Shield and potions. At levels 1-3, be cautious of Pantheon’s dashes and stuns, and counterattack with an AA + Q combo after he uses his W. At levels 3-6, it’s important to avoid unnecessary long trades and only engage in situations where you can win with burst damage. Proper wave management and suppressing the opponent's roams will help you leverage Fiora's strengths. After level 6, while being mindful of roams using your ultimate, Fiora has the advantage in 1v1s, so aim to negate the opponent's CC with Parry and secure vital hits to take them down. In team fights, be careful of Pantheon’s short burst damage and it’s crucial to enter from the side to avoid being peeled.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille excels in short trades against Pantheon, especially by avoiding his stun, allowing her to retaliate without taking damage. Pantheon's skills have long cooldowns, creating opportunities to counterattack after he has used his abilities. Additionally, by utilizing Camille's passive shield, she can mitigate Pantheon's burst damage. Furthermore, Camille has high mobility, making it easier to dodge Pantheon's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, from levels 1 to 2, she should trade using the cooldown of her passive without taking any skills. After assessing Pantheon's skills and forcing him to use his shield, she can initiate trades with her Q. After level 3, when she acquires Divine Sunderer, she should actively attack using the cooldowns and approach Pantheon while having her shield up, allowing her to block damage when stunned and retaliate. By using walls to avoid W and aiming for a counterattack with E, Camille can further strengthen her advantage.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite can retaliate with his Q while taking hits from Pantheon during early trades. Especially when Pantheon tries to all-in at levels 2 or 3, Malphite can deal damage with his Q while positioning himself behind minions. Additionally, by stacking armor, Malphite can reduce Pantheon's physical damage and gain an advantage by dragging the fight into a longer engagement.\n\nTo take advantage, start by safely farming CS behind minions while executing mini-trades with your Q. If you can avoid Pantheon's stun, you can gain an edge in trades. After level 6, it's important to use your R to participate in team fights or ganks, limiting Pantheon's movements. Also, purchasing armor items early will help you withstand Pantheon's attacks, making it easier to secure an advantage in lane.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high durability and sustain, and his crowd control (CC) in team fights is powerful. Pantheon is a champion that aims for short-term burst damage, but due to Cho'Gath's HP regeneration and percentage damage, he can mitigate Pantheon's damage in prolonged fights. Additionally, Cho'Gath's E silence can disrupt Pantheon's skill activation, effectively nullifying his all-in.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to conserve Q from levels 1 to 2, ensuring effective range for W with minions while not overcommitting. From levels 3 to 5, you should clear minions with E while aiming for small damage trades with Q→W, avoiding Pantheon's W stun. After level 6, use R to secure kills and position yourself as a tank in team fights to maintain an advantage. It is also crucial to respond to enemy roams with TP to increase your influence across the map.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that as Yorick levels up, he can summon the Maiden and use Mist Walkers to counter Pantheon with sheer numbers. In particular, while Pantheon has strong burst damage in the early game, Yorick can increase his durability with Doran’s Shield and avoid risky trades. Additionally, by pushing minions while healing with Yorick's Q, he can mitigate Pantheon’s attacks and progress the lane in his favor.\n\nTo take advantage, play safely from levels 1 to 3, waiting in front of the minions while being cautious of Pantheon’s E and W stuns. Avoid unnecessary trades, and after reaching level 3 and acquiring the Maiden (R), mark with E and push minions while healing with Q. When Pantheon roams, it’s important to either return with TP or push the minion wave to apply pressure on the tower and report to the jungle. In team fights and later stages, use the Maiden and Ghost to create division in the side lanes, and instead of forcing a front engagement, aim for one-on-one holds with W to gain an advantage in combat.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility, with all skills featuring dashes, making it easier to avoid Pantheon’s attacks. In particular, Anbessa can create distance before being stunned by Pantheon’s W, allowing for the avoidance of short-term burst damage. Additionally, by charging his passive, Anbessa can maintain sustained damage output, giving him an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, focus on farming minions without overextending, using Q and E to farm from a distance. Be cautious to avoid Pantheon’s attacks while conserving the shield from W to prepare for absorbing Pantheon’s engage. In the mid-game, it’s important to use R to target distant enemy carries and disrupt the frontline. In one-on-one situations, charging the passive and prolonging the fight will favor Anbessa. In team fights, it’s effective to engage from the side, using R to attack the enemy backline and continuing the chase with E’s slow.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, making him capable of a strong counter against Pantheon’s engage and all-in. By using Gragas's E, the barrel, he can limit Pantheon’s movements while making it easier to harass with his Q. Additionally, the healing effect from Gragas's W increases his durability against Pantheon’s short burst damage. Furthermore, after level 6, using his R can disrupt Pantheon’s roams and engages, allowing for favorable fights.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on farming with Q in the early game and zoning with barrels. It’s important to counterattack when Pantheon misses his skills and to sustain with W. After level 6, utilize R to split Pantheon’s movements and secure an advantage in team fights and skirmishes. In the mid to late game, leveraging Gragas's crowd control and AoE damage in team fights while exploiting Pantheon’s weaknesses will be key to victory.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has mobility to go over minions using his E, and he can block Pantheon’s Q with his Wind Wall. This allows Yasuo to negate Pantheon’s attacks while safely farming CS. Additionally, after reaching level 6, Yasuo can use his R to initiate a fight, creating opportunities to turn the tables against Pantheon.\n\nTo take advantage, from levels 1 to 3, Yasuo should stand behind minions, farm CS with Q, and use E to dodge Pantheon’s attacks. It’s important to use Wind Wall appropriately to block Pantheon’s Q while managing distance to avoid his W. After level 6, by observing the positioning of allies’ CC and summoners, Yasuo can look for the right moment to engage with R, creating a favorable situation against Pantheon.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire is strong in prolonged fights and has high health regeneration, allowing him to withstand Pantheon’s short-term burst. Pantheon aims for powerful all-ins in the early levels, but Bloodmire can use his W to avoid stuns and Q damage while trading and healing with Q. Additionally, after level 6, he can deal sustained damage with his R, making him impactful in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to carefully farm CS at the start and avoid Pantheon’s level 2 power spike. When Pantheon uses his W, you can poke while healing with Q to gain an advantage in trades. Also, when Pantheon faces you with his E, avoid attacking recklessly and instead look for opportunities to attack from the side to deal damage more easily. When using R at level 6 to retaliate, be cautious of Pantheon’s burst and conserve your W, allowing the game to drag on so you can leverage your item advantage for a comeback. Purchasing healing reduction items like Grievous Wounds early can also be effective.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone scales quickly and can deal high damage in team fights, making it easier to gain an edge over Pantheon. In particular, using Yone's E allows for risk-free trades, and he can withstand Pantheon's short burst damage. While Pantheon is strong in all-ins early on, Yone can prioritize CS while avoiding risky trades in the early lane phase, allowing him to withstand Panton's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize CS in the early lane phase (levels 1-5) and avoid Pantheon's W stun. By using E to poke and retreat quickly, Yone can deal damage without taking hits from Pantheon. After level 6, using R to create separation and coordinating with allies to attack can isolate Pantheon. Additionally, being mindful of sustain and building armor can help Yone maintain an advantage in prolonged fights.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Pantheon has strong early pressure, Nar is a champion that becomes stronger in the late game. Nar can utilize his mobility in mini form to avoid Pantheon's attacks, especially by dodging Pantheon's E and W charges, which helps prevent all-ins. Additionally, Nar's Q increases in damage as he stacks it, allowing him to prioritize farming in the early game while enduring Pantheon's attacks, ultimately enabling him to deal powerful damage in the late game.\n\nTo gain an advantage, start with items like Doran's Shield or healing-focused items to enhance early durability. In lane, prioritize farming and use W to escape Pantheon's attacks. When the jungler or roams come, position safely under the minions and aim to scale using TP or side-splitting strategies. In the mid-game, focus on split-pushing, stacking Q while creating threats to towers, and in team fights, use W on the front line to survive, allowing you to maintain an advantage over Pantheon.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum can utilize his tank characteristics and is strong in prolonged battles. Pantheon excels at short-term burst damage, but Braum has high sustain ability, especially in the mid-game, where he can continuously fight using the healing effect from his Q. Additionally, by using Braum's R, he can negate Pantheon's attacks while aggressively engaging.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to conserve Q behind minions in the early game and avoid Pantheon's short skirmishes. When Pantheon engages with his E, use W or Flash to minimize damage taken. After he uses his E, follow up with Q → AA for a short counterattack, dealing sustained damage. After level 6, while being cautious of Pantheon's roams, either use R to initiate an attack or prioritize tower pushing to secure lane dominance. The build should focus on health and regeneration early on, and it's effective to stack sustain and armor against Pantheon. Always be wary of ganks and manage minion positioning to avoid short-term damage.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled can carefully maneuver against Pantheon between levels 1 and 3 to avoid his powerful burst damage. By maintaining his Skaarl, Kled can gain sustained damage and durability, allowing him to counter Pantheon’s strategy of aiming for a quick finish. Additionally, by utilizing Kled's E and AA combo, he can deflect Pantheon’s attacks while retaliating.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary engagement between levels 1 and 3 and to endure behind the minions. When Pantheon attacks with Q→W→E, Kled can use W to wait for the burst and dodge the opponent's skills. After level 3, while maintaining Skaarl, it is effective to engage in a prolonged fight with E→AA×W, using Pantheon’s skill cooldowns to counterattack.\n\nFurthermore, by managing the minions and pushing back when Pantheon roams to secure vision, Kled can maximize his strength by participating in team fights with his R. In team fights, Kled can wait for Pantheon to initiate, then charge in with R to create a frontline or target an enemy while in a Skaarl state, allowing him to play advantageously."

      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vladimir has high sustained damage and sustain ability from early to mid-game, especially with his Q providing powerful HP recovery. Additionally, he can easily avoid Jax's attacks by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W, allowing him to gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, Vladimir excels at maintaining the lane, making it difficult for Jax to find the right moment to engage. Jax has low base health and defenses, making him particularly vulnerable in the early game, and he often cannot withstand Vladimir's sustained harassment.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming and avoid forcing trades. By checking Vladimir's Q cooldown and timing your dodges, you can minimize damage taken. Additionally, engaging in short trades and keeping your HP between 30%-40% can allow you to capitalize on Vladimir's low early stats. Moreover, coordinating with your team to target objectives can help compensate for your disadvantage in lane.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has a large HP pool and sustained sustain, making it easy to shrug off Gangplank's harassment. Additionally, Bloodmire has an invulnerability effect with his W, providing a means to avoid Gangplank's combos, making all-ins difficult. Furthermore, Bloodmire's enhanced Q burst damage is very high, and Gangplank has low base stats early on, making him susceptible to damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to harass with Q when Bloodmire is not enhanced, maintaining a favorable situation. Also, using barrels to create kill opportunities and chip away at Bloodmire's HP is key. If Bloodmire's HP is low enough, it is possible to aim for a kill by combining Flash, passive, Ignite, and Q. After obtaining the scene, trading against Bloodmire's enhanced Q becomes somewhat feasible, making the lane easier. However, avoiding the enhanced Q is extremely important. This will help reduce pressure in the lane and allow for more favorable engagements in fights.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail is very weak in the early game, especially until she reaches level 6, during which she remains at a disadvantage against other champions. Bloodmir excels at lane maintenance and has sustain through his Q, making it easy for him to retaliate when Kail tries to engage. Additionally, if Bloodmir utilizes the invulnerability effect from his W, Kail's attacks can be nullified, putting her at a disadvantage in early trades. Furthermore, Bloodmir has strong damage even after level 6, increasing the likelihood that he will secure kills before Kail can scale up.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on farming using her passive before level 6 and to avoid unnecessary trades. Pushing the wave under the tower can disrupt Bloodmir's CS and slow down his growth. After level 6, it is crucial to engage actively and to time the use of fully charged E or enhanced Q to avoid Bloodmir's ultimate damage. Asking teammates to bring healing reduction items is also an effective strategy to counter Bloodmir.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vladimir is strong in prolonged fights due to his lifesteal and relies on levels and items to grow. While Malphite is strong in short skirmishes, he cannot ignore Vladimir's healing ability, and when the fight drags on, he becomes disadvantaged. Additionally, when Vladimir uses his W (Pool), it negates Malphite's R (Ultimate) knock-up, making it difficult to deal effective damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase Bramble Vest early to reduce Vladimir's healing. After level 6, it is necessary to wait for Vladimir to use his W before timing an attack with R. Furthermore, focusing on short skirmishes and avoiding unnecessary extended fights is essential to prevent giving Vladimir opportunities to heal.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has high sustain ability in the early lane, thanks to his Q which provides HP recovery, allowing him to continuously fight even when taking damage from Renekton. Additionally, by utilizing Bloodmire's W invulnerability effect, it becomes easier to avoid Renekton's combos, increasing the likelihood of being able to counterattack. Furthermore, Bloodmire is favored against assassins and burst mages, and can effectively harass melee fighters like Renekton.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play aggressively from the start and look for trades when Bloodmire has no passive stacks on his Q. Also, by using E to close the distance and aiming for a stun with W, you can create favorable situations against Bloodmire. Additionally, acquiring items early and purchasing items that reduce healing can help suppress Bloodmire's sustain. In the later stages, maintaining pressure in side lanes and spreading out Bloodmire's damage in team fights can also be effective.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Bloodmire is weak in the early game, he excels at maintaining lane with sustain from his Q and can easily avoid Set's attacks by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W. Additionally, Bloodmire can deal sustained damage using his skills, making it difficult for Set to approach. Furthermore, since Bloodmire relies on items and levels, if he grows quickly, it becomes harder for Set to deal with him.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is recommended to build items that reduce healing effects. Also, freezing the lane and keeping the wave on your side is important to minimize harassment from Bloodmire and to engage in short trades. If you miss or misuse your skills, actively attacking to penalize him and roaming for a potential teleport to the bot lane for your team can also be effective.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has sustained healing and recovery abilities against Braum, who is weak to early-game crowd control. Bloodmire can harass while healing with his Q and can avoid Braum's attacks using the invulnerability effect of his W. Additionally, after level 6, Bloodmire can use his R to increase his impact in team fights, while Braum aims for short skirmishes, Bloodmire excels in prolonged battles. Furthermore, Braum's main skills have short range, making him vulnerable to Bloodmire's ranged attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early game, manage the lane carefully, prioritizing healing with minions while avoiding Bloodmire's Q.\n2. Attack when Bloodmire uses his W to force him to expend his skills, creating opportunities for counterattacks.\n3. In the mid-game and beyond, it is important to utilize ally ganks to isolate Bloodmire and aim for kills.\n4. Build tankier items to increase durability, making it easier to absorb Bloodmire's damage.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vladimir has the ability to deal sustained damage to Teemo in the early lane, and especially the healing effect from his Q reduces Teemo's harassment. Additionally, if Vladimir uses his W (Pool) to avoid Teemo's attacks, Teemo cannot deal damage and is more likely to be counterattacked. Furthermore, Vladimir has strong team fight capabilities after level 6 and high sustain in prolonged fights, making it difficult for Teemo to gain an advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to poke and isolate Vladimir in the early game. Specifically, using E to harass from a distance and applying blind with Q to neutralize damage is effective. Also, chasing after Vladimir uses his W can help avoid counterattacks. Additionally, purchasing early grievous wound items (like Morellonomicon) to reduce Vladimir's healing is also effective. In team fights, using mushrooms for zoning and avoiding close proximity to Vladimir is crucial.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vladimir has high healing and sustain, making him strong in prolonged trades. In particular, the healing effect from Vladimir's Q makes it difficult for Pantheon's early burst damage to be effective. Additionally, if Vladimir uses his W (Sanguine Pool) to avoid Pantheon's W (Charge + Stun), it becomes hard for Pantheon to follow up. As the game progresses, Vladimir's scaling in the late game is strong, which can put Pantheon at a disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively trade from levels 1 to 3 and apply pressure on Vladimir. Specifically, targeting the openings after he uses his W and attacking while maintaining distance with E or auto-attacks is effective. Also, clearing minions quickly and being aware of side lanes to influence other lanes can help shift the overall flow of the game in your favor. After level 6, it is crucial to be cautious of Vladimir's R while not missing opportunities to secure kills quickly.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vladimir has sustain from his Q early on, allowing him to harass while healing, making it easier to mitigate K'Sante's attacks. Additionally, by utilizing Vladimir's W for its invulnerability effect, he can avoid K'Sante's attacks while counterattacking. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range, making him more susceptible to Vladimir's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for K'Sante to actively use minions to dodge Vladimir's skills from the early game. Also, using E to avoid Vladimir's attacks while looking for counterattack opportunities can be effective. In terms of item builds, it is advisable to prioritize durability while selecting items that can reduce Vladimir's damage. Moreover, coordinating with teammates to set up ganks can help suppress Vladimir's strengths.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that there is a high possibility that his knock-up can be avoided due to the invulnerability effect of Bloodmiar's W. Yasuo excels in short skirmishes, but Bloodmiar has strong sustain after level 6 and can deal continuous damage, making him disadvantaged in prolonged fights. Additionally, since Bloodmiar uses HP to cast his skills, if his W is used at the right timing, Yasuo's attacks can be negated, increasing the risk of counterattacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during levels 1 to 5, it is important to avoid prolonged fights, focusing on CS with Q while using E to jump over minions and aiming for short E+Q trades. Next, it is effective to time your knock-up when Bloodmiar's W is on cooldown. Additionally, purchasing early damage items (like IE or PD) can help aim to take down Bloodmiar quickly. Furthermore, having a summoner spell (Ignite) can help suppress Bloodmiar's healing, aiding in gaining an advantage in fights.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Bloodmire has a long cooldown in the early game, he has sustain from his Q and specializes in dealing continuous damage. In particular, he can easily avoid Quinn's attacks by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W, allowing him to deal sustained damage in team fights as well. Additionally, Bloodmire relies on items and levels, which means he can grow quickly, and if Quinn does not scale well, she can easily lose her presence. Furthermore, Quinn has low base stats and is vulnerable to ganks, making her susceptible to Bloodmire's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase the Executioner's Calling early to suppress Bloodmire's healing. Additionally, using the Sanguine Blade can help counter his sustain. If you can get ahead, rushing for the Duskblade and initiating attacks can be effective. If you cannot get ahead, it is recommended to quickly buy a Hexdrinker and back before fighting a level 6 or higher Bloodmire. Moreover, making erratic movements can help you gain an advantage over Bloodmire.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the healing abilities and high durability of Vladimir. Vladimir can recover HP with his Q sustain and use the invulnerability effect of his W to negate Camille's E attacks. Additionally, Vladimir becomes stronger in the mid to late game, making it likely that he can withstand Camille's burst damage in the early game. Furthermore, Vladimir excels at poking in lane, making it easier for him to deal damage with his Q and E when Camille tries to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, Camille should actively look for all-ins between levels 1 and 5 to exhaust Vladimir's W. By saving her E and attacking after Vladimir uses his W, she can deal damage more effectively. Additionally, purchasing Grievous Wounds items can be effective in reducing his healing. After level 6, Camille should aim to isolate Vladimir with her R and deal burst damage. In team fights, it is important for Camille to utilize her mobility to position herself well and avoid being targeted by Vladimir's R.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire excels at dealing sustained damage from the early game, particularly with his Q, which allows him to maintain lane effectively. Additionally, he can easily avoid Garen's attacks by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W, and even if Garen uses his silence, Bloodmire has opportunities to counterattack. Furthermore, Bloodmire has high roaming potential and can secure kills easily, increasing his overall impact on the game. While Garen is strong in close combat, Bloodmire's skills make it difficult for him to leverage that strength.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Ward the area to keep an eye on Bloodmire's roaming, reducing his impact on the mid lane and other lanes.\n2. Destroy towers early to create a situation where Bloodmire finds it difficult to roam.\n3. Be cautious when approaching to force Bloodmire to use his Q, allowing for favorable trades.\n4. Purchase boots early to gain an advantage in early trades and regain lane control.\n5. Choose items that provide magic resist to reduce Bloodmire's damage.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, Garen can alleviate his disadvantage against Bloodmire and enhance his presence in the lane.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vladimir has a high ability to deal sustained damage from the early game, especially with his Q providing strong sustain. Gwen has a short range, making her susceptible to Vladimir's attacks, and it's difficult for her to gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, Vladimir's W grants him invulnerability, which nullifies Gwen's attacks, making all-ins very troublesome. Furthermore, Vladimir scales quickly and relies on items and levels, so if he gains control early on, Gwen can easily lose her presence in the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to take Ignite to suppress Vladimir's healing. When he tries to use his empowered Q, countering with E and W, and then going for an all-in after he uses his pool can be effective. Also, using Ignite before Vladimir can heal significantly allows you to reduce his sustain and trade more favorably.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vladimir is strong in prolonged fights and has healing capabilities with his Q, allowing him to deal sustained damage. Additionally, he can use the invulnerability effect of his W to avoid Shen's E (Taunt), which may cause Shen to miss his opportunity to engage. Furthermore, Vladimir excels at lane sustain, and when Shen tries to push, he becomes more susceptible to harassment. Shen lacks AoE damage and relies on his allies for damage output in team fights, making it difficult to counter Vladimir's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to stretch out the early lane phase unnecessarily and aim for a quick resolution. It is essential to time your E (Taunt) to attack when Vladimir's W is on cooldown and deal damage as quickly as possible. After level 6, utilizing your R to intervene in side lanes and influence the map can help diminish Vladimir's strengths relatively. Additionally, purchasing MR items early as a counter to AP can also be effective in increasing durability in team fights.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Bloodmiar's early poke ability and sustain. Bloodmiar can poke with his E while maintaining health with his Q, making it difficult for Fiora to create advantageous situations when she tries to engage. Additionally, if Bloodmiar effectively uses his W (the invulnerable pool), he can negate Fiora's attacks, increasing the risk of counterattacks. Furthermore, Bloodmiar's R after level 6 poses a threat, making it hard for Fiora to go all-in.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid long trades in the early lane and focus on short Q → AA combos to chip away at health. Observing the cooldowns of Bloodmiar's W and E and timing your attacks after he uses W can be effective. After level 6, aim to finish fights using your R and apply pressure through tower taking or side pushing strategies. It's also crucial to build lifesteal and sustain through items to increase damage early on."

      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick possesses high base stats and the ability to summon pets, making it easier for him to gain an upper hand against opponents who lack burst damage, such as Bloodmire. By using Yorick's W to create walls, he can restrict Bloodmire's movement, and after marking him with E, he can attack while healing with Q, dealing sustained damage. Additionally, by utilizing Bloodmire's invulnerability effect from his W, Yorick can more easily execute attacks with the Maiden, hindering Bloodmire's healing.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, Yorick should push the lane and engage in short trades while using minions as a shield. By marking Bloodmire with E and continuing to attack while healing with Q, he can apply pressure on Bloodmire. Once reaching level 6, he should summon the Maiden early, create a wall with W to trap Bloodmire, and aim for a kill with E → Q + AA → Ignite. It is also important to use Flash and Ignite to stop Bloodmire's healing. This way, Yorick can more easily seize control of the lane.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has a dash attached to all of his skills, allowing him to utilize his high mobility to deal short-term damage to Bloodmire easily. Especially considering Bloodmire's self-healing and invulnerability effect (W), Anbessa can time his attacks effectively during trades. Additionally, Bloodmire has a long cooldown in the early game and low DPS, making it easier for Anbessa to take the initiative by being aggressive.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, safely clear minions using Q and E in the early game to charge his passive and prepare for short trades. Be aware of Bloodmire's healing from Q and avoid engaging immediately after he heals. During trades, it is important to utilize the passive charge and E's slow to ensure successful attacks while conserving the W shield to absorb Bloodmire's E (wave).\n\nFurthermore, when Bloodmire uses Sanguine Pool, refrain from chasing, and after the cooldown, use R to suppress him and look for opportunities to deal damage. In the mid-game and beyond, aim for carries through side lanes or TP, and dive into the backline with R while maintaining the slow with E, allowing for sustained damage in team fights. For item selection, purchase Bramble early to counter healing, and depending on the game's progression, choose items like Yuumi or Mercury's Treads to prepare for countering Bloodmire.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has a wide range of hard crowd control and can deal high damage through consecutive attacks. Bloodmire has a long cooldown in the early game and low DPS, making it easier for Aatrox to take the initiative by playing aggressively. Additionally, Aatrox's passive healing effect allows him to maintain durability during sustained trades, making him strong against Bloodmire's harassment.\n\nTo take advantage, first, play aggressively after reaching level 4 and actively poke Bloodmire. In particular, after using Aatrox's Q3, you can force Bloodmire to use his W by following up with an auto-attack. After he uses his W, there is an opportunity to attack again before it comes off cooldown. It is also important to avoid Bloodmire's enhanced Q, but since you can still deal damage with the regular Q, timing your attacks effectively is key.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven can deal high burst damage with short combos from the early game, allowing her to engage before Bloodmire can activate his healing. Additionally, Riven can use her W, which has a stun, to negate Bloodmire's pool, increasing her chances to deal damage. Furthermore, Riven has high mobility, making it easier for her to dodge Bloodmire's skills.\n\nTo take advantage, Riven should manage minions while repeatedly trading short trades between levels 1 and 3, drawing aggro with her passive and Q. She should aim for the timing to use her W's stun to crush Bloodmire's pool, maximizing her attacks. After level 6, it is important to force Bloodmire to use his ultimate before going all-in and to consider early Graves or penetration items as a sustain counter. This way, she can suppress Bloodmire's healing while dealing consistent damage.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has high damage output from the early game, and by using Q to push minions while building Heat, he can gain an advantage in short trades. Additionally, by utilizing the slow effect from E, he can limit the movement of Bloodmire, allowing him to maintain an edge in trades. Furthermore, Rumble can deal significant damage when overheated, making it difficult for Bloodmire to find opportunities to heal.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, use Q to push minions while managing Heat and engaging in short trades. It is important to time the E slow when Bloodmire attempts to heal with Q, allowing for continued damage through follow-up. After level 6, use R to zone Bloodmire, and after forcing him to use W, follow up to build further advantage. Additionally, roaming and applying pressure in other lanes can enhance overall map control.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high burst damage and possesses blink abilities, making it easier to dodge Bloodmiar's skills. In particular, by using Irelia's E to avoid Bloodmiar's attacks while stacking damage with Q, she can deal sustained damage. Additionally, after reaching level 6, Irelia can use her R to eliminate Bloodmiar instantly and can deliver high DPS in team fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, focus on minion management in the early game while conserving Q and securing E stacks. Once you reach level 6, aim for an all-in on Bloodmiar using R, and unleash a combo of E → Q → R to deal significant damage. It is crucial to time your skills to avoid the invulnerability effect of Bloodmiar's W. Furthermore, prioritize tank killers in item selection to effectively reduce Bloodmiar's healing. In team fights, utilize crowd control to stop Bloodmiar's sustained damage while quickly eliminating targets and disengaging.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high early-game durability, making it easier to withstand attacks from Bloodmire. In the early game, Bloodmire has long cooldowns and low damage, making it difficult to gain control over Ornn. Additionally, by harassing with Ornn's Q (Fire Arrow), it becomes easier to chip away at Bloodmire's HP, and you can maintain distance while attacking using W (Fire Breath). Furthermore, Ornn's R (Rage of the Earth) knock-up is very effective at cutting off Bloodmire's escape routes.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, harass Bloodmire with Ornn's Q while continuing to attack from a distance with W. After level 6, use R to limit Bloodmire's movements, and in team fights, it is important to act as a tank on the front line to protect your allies. Additionally, prioritize tank items in your build and choose items with magic resistance to reduce Bloodmire's damage while increasing your durability. Always be mindful of your positioning and avoid Bloodmire's skill combos.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath can lock down Bloodmire with his E's CC and silence him with his W, preventing Bloodmire from using his W (Sanguine Pool). This means that Bloodmire loses his means of healing and avoiding damage, allowing Cho'Gath to trade more favorably. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration, giving him sustainability in prolonged fights and making it easier to counter Bloodmire's continuous damage.\n\nTo take advantage, first catch Bloodmire with E, apply silence with W, and then deal damage with Q or R. After level 6, it's important to use R to increase size and HP, allowing for a stronger body block while coordinating with the jungle to secure kills. Also, by provoking Bloodmire's W before using your own skills, you can deal damage more effectively. In lane, prioritizing CS while reading Bloodmire's movements to trade favorably is key.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Mordekaiser can use his R (Realm of Death) to force a 1v1 situation with Vladimir, allowing him to fight very favorably. Since Vladimir uses HP to cast his skills, Mordekaiser can maintain his durability while dealing damage by leveraging his sustained damage and shield (W: Indestructible). Additionally, Mordekaiser's passive sustained damage can outpace Vladimir's sustain, giving him an edge in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it's important to use the shield from W while pulling in minions with E (Death's Grasp) to farm safely, and once reaching level 6, to initiate a 1v1 with Vladimir using R. In terms of item selection, prioritizing Riftmaker and Liandry's Anguish will enhance sustained damage, allowing Mordekaiser to continuously pressure Vladimir. Furthermore, coordinating with the jungler to set up ganks can effectively overwhelm Vladimir and secure lane dominance.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he possesses powerful skills after level 6, particularly his W, which slows and reduces attack speed, limiting Bloodmire's attacks. Bloodmire can disrupt Nasus's Q with ranged attacks, but Nasus can use minions to stack his Q and increase his durability. Additionally, Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game and can deal high damage even with a tank build, allowing him to gain an advantage over Bloodmire as he grows.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize farming Q stacks from minions without forcing attacks between levels 1 and 5. Manage your health while avoiding Bloodmire's E, and it is crucial to stop him with W when he engages. After level 6, increase your durability with R and aim for single kills using W and Q. By using Flash and vision to close the gap and attacking quickly, you can create a favorable situation against Bloodmire.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability from the early game and can pressure Vladimir from a distance with his Q. Vladimir has a long cooldown and low DPS in the early game, making it difficult for him to counter Sion's toughness. Additionally, Sion has multiple CC skills, and he excels at engaging in team fights with his R for the charge and knock-up. While being cautious of Vladimir's healing, Sion can deal damage using his W and E.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to poke Vladimir from a distance with Q between levels 1 and 3 to chip away at his HP. Prioritize minion management, and once Vladimir uses his W (Pool), look for the next opportunity. Before level 6, avoid unnecessary extended trades, leave damage with short combos, and use Sion's durability to withstand damage. After level 6, be wary of Vladimir's full healing and damage, and look for opportunities to take him down with Sion's R or full combos while his Pool is on cooldown. In team fights, it is crucial to initiate at the front, be careful not to displace Vladimir, and restrain the main assassins to allow your allies to deal damage."

  "クイン": {
    "name": "クイン",
    "beats": {
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Quinn's high range and mobility. Quinn excels at poking from a distance and can quickly disengage after a short skirmish using her E. In contrast, Braum is a melee champion, making it difficult to approach and susceptible to Quinn's attacks. Additionally, Braum's main skills have short range, making it hard to avoid Quinn's attacks, which makes lane competition tough. Furthermore, Quinn has a strong ability to roam and apply pressure from side lanes, which Braum is particularly vulnerable to.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early stages of laning, it is important not to force an approach and to farm while using minions as a shield to avoid Quinn's attacks. Additionally, timing an engagement when Quinn's E is on cooldown and using ult or dashes to attack all at once can be effective. Strengthening coordination with the jungle to aim for ganks can also apply pressure on Quinn. Finally, securing vision and preventing Quinn's roams can help alleviate the disadvantage in lane.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Quinn's high mobility and burst damage. Quinn has a long range and can use her E (Blind) to negate Jax's basic attacks and avoid damage. Additionally, Quinn creates openings after using her skills, allowing for counterattacks, but her mobility often allows her to escape, making Jax, who is weak against sustained harassment, susceptible to damage in the early game. Furthermore, while Quinn is vulnerable to ganks, Jax is also weak in the early game, increasing the risk of being ganked.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play carefully in the early game and attack after Quinn uses her E. Equipping a Doran's Shield or armor to prioritize survival and maintain health is necessary. Relying on ganks can also be effective in creating favorable situations against Quinn. In terms of item build, maximizing Ninja Tabi and Q can enhance sustainability by baiting Quinn's abilities. Playing cautiously while preparing for the late game and showcasing strength will be the key to victory.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven is a melee champion, making it difficult for her to approach against Quinn's long-range harassment and ability to deny vision. Quinn can use her range to harass Riven, especially in the early lane phase, where Riven is often countered when trying to close the gap with her Q. Additionally, Riven is vulnerable to Quinn's burst damage, and after level 6, Riven is more likely to be forced into 1v1 situations due to Quinn's roaming.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to hide behind minions in the early lane phase and approach with Q, retreating quickly with short combos. When Quinn roams, pushing the wave under the tower and coordinating with the jungler to create counterplay opportunities can be effective. After level 3, look for opportunities to engage with a short burst (Q×3 + W + E) while trying to avoid Quinn's attacks. Furthermore, managing vision and keeping track of Quinn's movements can increase opportunities to capitalize on Riven's strengths.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has strong harassment abilities from the early game, making it easy to apply pressure in the lane. Quinn actively attacks using AA and Q, and since Kail is very weak in the early game, she can easily find herself in a disadvantageous situation if she tries to trade aggressively. Additionally, after level 6, Quinn can use her ultimate to roam and apply pressure in side lanes, making it difficult for Kail to farm during that time. Furthermore, against Quinn's high mobility and burst damage, Kail struggles to survive in the early game, especially when she gets close.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize safety in the lane, focusing on clearing minions with Q while avoiding Quinn's harassment. Once reaching level 6, use the ultimate to withstand Quinn's attacks and look for opportunities to counterattack. Seeking jungle support can also increase opportunities to counter Quinn. By securing vision and engaging in team fights that extend into the late game, Kail can leverage her strengths. Choosing items that focus on scaling is crucial, as growing stronger will allow her to shine in the late game.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Quinn's long range and harassment ability. In the early game, Quinn can use her Q to poke Yone from a distance, making it difficult for him to approach. Additionally, Quinn has high mobility and can easily create distance with her E, making it challenging for Yone to close the gap. Furthermore, after level 6, Quinn can use her R to roam and impact other lanes, which puts Yone under pressure in his lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force engagements in the early game and to use minions to create angles for E. Additionally, positioning to avoid Quinn's Q and purchasing sustain items early to maintain HP is effective. After level 6, while being cautious of Quinn's R, look for opportunities to go for a one-shot and aim to engage from behind in team fights.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and burst damage, giving her an advantage over Garen, especially in lane trades. Quinn's E skill disrupts Garen's Q skill, making it a significant obstacle when Garen tries to engage. Additionally, Quinn can attack from a distance, allowing her to deal damage before Garen can close the gap, making it difficult for Garen to secure CS in lane. Furthermore, Quinn has a strong ability to influence other lanes, which Garen cannot stop.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid fights in lane. Garen should focus on farming safely and maintaining his lane. Incorporating items like Stridebreaker and using Exhaust can increase his options against Quinn. Moreover, anticipating good ganks and coordinating with the allied jungler can apply pressure on Quinn. Leveraging Garen's scaling potential in the mid-game and progressing the game without rushing will be key to finding victory.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn is a marksman with ranged attacks, allowing her to maneuver advantageously against Darius, who has a short range. Quinn can harass Darius with her Q and auto-attacks from the early game, making it difficult for him to approach. Additionally, after using her E (Vault), Quinn can engage, making it hard for Darius to close the gap. Furthermore, Quinn's blind effect makes it harder for Darius to land his attacks, reducing his opportunities to deal damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to focus on surviving in the early lane phase and using minions to avoid Quinn's attacks. While dealing damage with Q (Bleed), aim to catch Quinn with E (Apprehend) at the right moment. Additionally, receiving support from the jungle can help apply pressure on Quinn. After level 6, consider using R to create opportunities for kills and turn the tide.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremdamer is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Quinn's range and harassment ability. Quinn can attack from a distance and use her Q and E to wear down Tryndamere. Additionally, Quinn's E allows her to trade favorably in short engagements, dealing damage before Tryndamere can close the gap. Furthermore, after level 6, Quinn has high mobility and can eliminate enemies instantly with her R, making Tryndamere prone to unfavorable situations in team fights and duels.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to conserve potions in the early game and manage minions effectively. Maintaining distance to avoid Quinn's harassment while saving E for close combat is essential. Also, in short trades around levels 2-3, Tryndamere can play aggressively, making it effective to poke and aim for critical hits with Q. Additionally, being wary of Quinn's roams and securing vision can help limit her movements.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Quinn's high mobility and burst damage. Quinn has a long range and can avoid Renekton's stun with her E, making it difficult for him to engage. Additionally, Quinn is favored against low-sustain fighters or those who rely heavily on snowballing, while Renekton is strong against fighters that come close. However, when Quinn attacks while maintaining the right distance, Renekton becomes susceptible to damage. Furthermore, without Fury, Renekton's combo damage decreases, and he quickly loses HP when hit by Quinn's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important for Renekton to use minions to position himself before taking damage from Quinn. When Quinn engages, he should heal with W while managing his Fury and timing his combos. Additionally, attacking when Quinn's E is on cooldown can limit her escape options. Finally, adjusting the item build to increase durability can also be effective in withstanding Quinn's burst damage.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and ranged attacks in the early game, forcing Nasus to farm under the tower, making it difficult to stack his Q. Quinn can use her E to engage and disengage repeatedly, applying pressure on Nasus. Additionally, Nasus is very weak in the early game and vulnerable to Quinn's burst damage. Furthermore, Quinn has strong roaming capabilities, allowing her to create advantages in other lanes while Nasus is farming, which puts Nasus in an overall disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the priority is to safely farm under the tower and stack Q. It is important not to force trades, use wards to avoid Quinn's attacks, and be cautious of jungle ganks. Also, having Teleport as a summoner spell allows Nasus to join other lanes when necessary, increasing the overall strength of the team. In the mid to late game, as Nasus grows stronger, it is essential to focus on his role in team fights and aim to deal damage by utilizing his Q stacks.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and burst damage, making Gangplank vulnerable when approached, leading to unfavorable trades. Quinn's passive allows for combos and crowd control skills that can deny vision, making it difficult for Gangplank to harass or farm in lane. Additionally, Quinn has a long range and can easily break Gangplank's barrels, limiting his damage output.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Stay behind caster minions and farm with Q to safely manage minions while avoiding Quinn's attacks.\n2. When Quinn auto-attacks, use the opportunity to farm under the turret as the wave gets pushed in.\n3. Request ganks from the jungler to create opportunities to catch Quinn.\n4. Complete the Triforce early in the item build to gain the damage needed to contest Quinn.\n5. Choose Warlord as a rune to improve sustain and gain an advantage in lane.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, Gangplank can alleviate his disadvantage in the matchup against Quinn and play more effectively.",
      "ナー": "NAR is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and excels at long-range attacks, making it easy for her to hinder NAR's approach. In particular, Quinn's passive and Q burst damage make NAR very vulnerable when in mini form, making it difficult to engage all-in. Additionally, Quinn has skills that can deny vision, making NAR more easily detected when trying to approach through bushes, often limiting his movement.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, NAR should use the bushes to avoid Quinn's attacks in order to prevent harassment in lane. It is also crucial to manage the timing of his transformation properly and to actively engage when in Mega NAR form. In terms of item build, prioritizing items that increase durability is essential to withstand Quinn's attacks. Furthermore, predicting Quinn's movements and aiming for ambushes can help NAR gain an advantage in the laning phase."
    },
    "loses": {
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high physical defense and demonstrates strong durability, especially against AD champions. Quinn is a ranged carry, but by using Malphite's E to reduce her attack speed, we can decrease Quinn's auto-attack damage. Additionally, Malphite's R has powerful engage potential, allowing us to secure kills after Quinn uses her mobility skill.\n\nTo take advantage, we should start by choosing durability-focused items and manage minions while taking some harassment. After Quinn approaches or disengages with her E, we can use our E to lower her attack speed and bring the fight to close range. When Quinn relies heavily on auto-attacks, we can retaliate through minions with W or E, and use Q as a trigger for engaging or escaping. After level 6, we should engage with R when Quinn's mobility skill is on cooldown or when our allies have crowd control available, ensuring we can secure kills. We also need to be aware of Quinn's roaming, check the minimap, and place wards to prepare for counterattacks when we can join with teleport.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control skills, and particularly with his E, he can easily limit Quinn's movements. Additionally, K'Sante's shield from his W and his durability help counter Quinn's burst damage. While Quinn has high mobility, K'Sante's damage and durability increase in all-out situations, allowing him to gain the upper hand in one-on-one combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to secure CS in the lane while avoiding Quinn's attacks. When Quinn engages, using E to restrict her movement and then countering with W allows for damage to be dealt. Also, being aware of Quinn's ultimate, using Ghost at level 6 to actively engage can create a favorable situation against her. Furthermore, building items like Warden's Mail or Steelplate can reduce Quinn's kill threat and enable sustained fighting.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and AoE damage, making him skilled at engaging in team fights. Quinn has high mobility, but her burst damage struggles against Sion's CC skills and durability. Additionally, Sion can withstand Quinn's attacks, allowing him to gain an advantage by getting close and trading blows.\n\nTo take advantage, first focus on harassing in the lane, using Q to deal damage to Quinn while maintaining durability with W's shield. By maximizing E, you can restrict Quinn's movement and cancel her combos by landing Q when she approaches. After pushing the lane, it's important to buy a ZZ'Rot and increase pressure on the tower to prevent roaming. Coordinate with teammates and ping to alert them when Quinn is roaming, minimizing her impact.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has high ability power and excellent skill motion, allowing him to effectively utilize his passive to aim for stuns, especially against melee champions. Quinn has high mobility, but in close combat, she is vulnerable to Kennen's stuns and burst damage. Additionally, Quinn has weak AoE damage and struggles to counter Kennen's wide area control with his ultimate in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, harass with Q while conserving W to chase after being hit. At levels 2-3, it's important to use E to sidestep and stack the passive to three for a short all-in. By predicting Quinn's E and countering, you can avoid her burst while dealing damage. In team fights, use your ultimate to engage and coordinate with your teammates to utilize stuns, allowing you to gain the upper hand against Quinn.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick has high base stats and durability, making him particularly strong in close combat. Quinn excels at harassment from a distance and burst damage, but Yorick can easily create a health advantage with small combos after level 3, allowing him to play favorably in extended fights. Additionally, the Maiden and Mist Walkers summoned by Yorick's W can utilize overwhelming numbers to attack Quinn, making it difficult for her to take them down in one hit, thus giving Yorick an edge in prolonged battles.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game, push the minions and create a health difference against Quinn using small combos after level 3 while farming soldiers. After level 6, utilize the Maiden to create opportunities in bushes or valleys, avoiding situations where Quinn can poke and disengage quickly. Furthermore, in item selection, it is important to focus on healing and durability, and choosing Bramble Vest to suppress Quinn's healing is crucial. By thoroughly managing vision and keeping track of the enemy jungle's position while split-pushing, you can advance the game in your favor by targeting towers.",
      "アカリ": "Akali has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali possesses high mobility and burst damage, making her particularly strong against opponents with low engage potential, like Quinn. By using Akali's Smoke (W), she can obscure Quinn's vision and retaliate while avoiding attacks. Additionally, Akali has up to four consecutive blinks (E), allowing her to dodge Quinn's attacks while pursuing her. Furthermore, Akali has strong HP regeneration and excels at lane sustain, making it easier for her to withstand Quinn's assaults.\n\nTo take advantage, initially play passively, stabilizing the lane without fearing a slight loss of CS. After level 6, opportunities for kills increase, so baiting Quinn's E and then aiming for a double Q makes it easier to deal damage. Also, when Quinn roams, use spam ping as soon as you lose vision of her to be cautious of her movements, push the lane, and then set up an ambush to thwart her roam. In terms of item build, starting with Doran's Shield and purchasing Ninja Tabi early makes it easier to counter Quinn's attacks.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has melee burst damage and healing, making it easier to aim for a quick finish against Quinn's ranged attacks. Especially after Quinn uses her E, there is a cooldown, allowing Irelia to exploit that gap to attack. Additionally, by using Irelia's Q to approach through minions, she can avoid Quinn's harassment while trading favorably.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from the start of the lane until levels 1-5, use minions to safely farm CS with Q and aim for trades by utilizing the Q reset. It is important to avoid long trades against Quinn's ranged auto-attacks and Q, and to use minions and bushes to close the gap. Immediately after Quinn uses her E, take advantage of that cooldown to move forward and attack with a short burst. Specifically, a combo of Q through minions → W for damage reduction → auto-attack → Q would be effective.\n\nAfter level 6, while being cautious of Quinn's roams with her R, prioritize diving onto carries in team fights. It is more effective to slip in from a distance and deal burst damage rather than trying to corner Quinn. Being aware of movements to avoid Quinn's blind and blink (such as sidestepping or using minions as shields) and understanding the timing of her E usage will be key to victory.",
      "セト": "Set has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Set has high durability and sustained damage against Quinn, making him particularly strong in skirmishes. Against Quinn's burst damage, Set can leverage his passive for HP regeneration and shields, allowing him to gain the upper hand in prolonged fights. Additionally, by using Set's E, he can cancel Quinn's movement, effectively limiting her mobility.\n\nTo take advantage, first, prioritize acquiring W, then E, and maximize Q to trade favorably against Quinn. Play hyper-aggressively in lane, aiming to push Quinn out. It's also important to secure vision and stay close enough to Quinn to see her even when she uses her blind. In terms of item build, purchasing armor boots early and focusing on a tank build will allow you to play more strongly against Quinn.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has strong denial capabilities against Quinn in close combat. He can deal damage with his Q, \"Flame Breath,\" while using his E, \"Terrain Knock-Up,\" to catch Quinn. Additionally, he can absorb Quinn's attacks with the W's \"Shield\" effect and create advantageous situations by closing the distance. Furthermore, Ornn excels at lane maintenance and has high sustain, allowing him to endure Quinn's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, first control the minions in the early lane phase, freezing or pushing to lure Quinn into close combat. When Quinn tries to maintain distance, aim for a knock-up using the Q→E combo while utilizing the terrain, and approach while shielding with W. Once you reach level 6, use your R to prevent Quinn's roams or ambushes, and in team fights, it's important to step forward and use CC to protect your allies. This way, Ornn can maintain a favorable situation against Quinn.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille excels in close combat, especially after level 6, where she can deal high burst damage during all-ins. Quinn is good at harassing from a distance, but Camille can close the gap using her E, retaliating with a shield from her W and guaranteed damage from her Q. Additionally, Camille's passive shield helps mitigate Quinn's burst damage, giving her an edge in long trades.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, gather minions to avoid Quinn's harassment while looking for the right moment to use E. Use E in response to Quinn's engage or escape, and capitalize on the CC from W to isolate her with R, creating an opportunity to take her down instantly. Once you reach level 6, it's important to use wards to secure vision, preventing Quinn from roaming while aiming for an all-in. Also, by pushing the lane while being cautious of Quinn's roams, you can apply pressure across the entire map.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nThere are several reasons why Teemo is favored against Quinn. First, Teemo's Q (blind effect) can neutralize Quinn's basic attacks, allowing Teemo to gain the upper hand in trades where Quinn relies on auto-attacks (AA). Additionally, Teemo can deal damage from a distance, enabling him to inflict damage before Quinn can get close. Furthermore, Teemo's E (poison dart) provides sustained damage, and his mushrooms (R) offer zone control, which can suppress Quinn's roaming and split-pushing.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, Teemo should use his Q to initiate short trades with Quinn from levels 1 to 3, applying sustained damage with E. It's important to place mushrooms in the brush to secure vision and use Q to blind Quinn as she approaches, continuing to deal damage with auto-attacks. After level 6, Teemo should spread mushrooms to maintain vision and deter Quinn's roaming while contributing to team fights by applying poison from the backline. This way, Teemo can maintain lane dominance and secure an overall advantage in the match.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and is characterized by a playstyle that consumes HP while fighting. Quinn is a carry with burst damage, but Dr. Mundo's durability in prolonged fights due to his ultimate is superior, allowing him to withstand Quinn's attacks. Additionally, Quinn's attacks are primarily strong against single targets, but Dr. Mundo's high tankiness makes it easier for him to mitigate Quinn's damage.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, in the early lane phase, prioritize CS while avoiding Quinn's ranged attacks and healing with your W. When Quinn uses her E to engage, it's an opportunity to counterattack, so aim for a short skirmish. After level 6, utilize Dr. Mundo's ultimate to engage in prolonged fights, allowing you to withstand Quinn's roams. In team fights, it's important to step forward, absorb crowd control, and use your healing to buy time for your AD carry to do their job.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has high base stats and percentage damage, making him particularly strong in the early levels from 1 to 3. Quinn has a shorter range and weak AoE damage, so when she gets caught by Urgot's E, she is susceptible to taking significant damage. Additionally, Urgot has a high-performance shield, giving him durability against Quinn's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on sustaining behind the minions in the early game while avoiding harassment from Quinn's Q. After level 3, use E to catch Quinn and aim for a combo with W and auto-attacks to deal damage. When Quinn tries to create distance with her E, it's important to use the minions to close the gap and trade favorably. Additionally, pushing the lane to prevent Quinn's roams and freezing the minions can keep pressure on her.\n\nIn team fights, Urgot aims to lock down enemies at the front line and execute the enemy carry with his R. By maintaining vision control and always being aware of Quinn's movements, you can maximize Urgot's strengths.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen is a melee champion who can negate Quinn's ranged attacks with his W while protecting minions. Additionally, Shen's E has a taunt, which allows him to limit Quinn's actions by using E the moment she approaches, creating an opportunity to chase. Furthermore, Shen's R can support allies from an infinite range, allowing him to assist teammates even when Quinn roams, making it easier to maintain overall map pressure.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, use W to avoid Quinn's harassment while securing CS and protecting minions. When Quinn approaches with her E, time your E to land the taunt and then follow up with Q. After level 6, utilize R to support allies and ensure vision when Quinn roams to avoid losing out on teleport. In team fights, use the R shield to act as a tank on the front line, allowing Quinn to target the sides or back, thereby leveraging Shen's tanking ability to increase the overall survival rate of the team.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has high durability and healing capabilities, allowing him to deal powerful damage, especially against opponents with low burst mobility like Quinn. Aatrox's skills excel in continuous attacks and have a knock-up effect, making it easier to limit Quinn's movements. Additionally, Quinn has weak AoE damage, making it difficult for her to effectively deal damage to Aatrox in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, start with a Doran's Shield and maximize E to aim for early farming at a high level. It's important to farm under the tower while keeping Blood Well at 3 stacks and to seize opportunities to all-in for a kill when Quinn misses her Q or uses her knockback. In the mid-game, Aatrox becomes stronger than Quinn, so it's also crucial to endure while seeking support from the jungler. In terms of item build, rushing for Ninja Tabi and a Vampiric Scepter is necessary, while timing your counterattacks to avoid Quinn's attacks. Securing vision and capitalizing on opportunities to deal significant damage when Quinn is at 500-600 HP after level 6 will be key to victory.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is strong in close combat and can easily approach champions with high mobility like Quinn using his E skill. Quinn has a shorter range and weak AoE damage, allowing Mordekaiser's sustained damage and shields to shine. Additionally, by using Mordekaiser's R skill, he can trap Quinn in the realm of death, forcing a 1v1 situation, which can turn the fight in his favor.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to trade effectively in lane before reaching level 6 and to chip away at Quinn's HP. Approach with the E skill, deal damage with the Q skill, and increase durability with the W skill for shields. Once reaching level 6, using the R skill to isolate Quinn and fight will nullify her mobility and lead to victory. Furthermore, gathering items will enhance his strength, so purchasing items at the right timing is also crucial.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora excels in close combat and can gain the upper hand, especially in one-on-one fights. Quinn has ranged attacks and harasses with high mobility, but Fiora can parry Quinn's key skills with her W, negating damage while counterattacking. Additionally, by using Fiora's R, she can reliably target vitals, dealing extra damage while also healing herself. This allows Fiora to deal sustained damage to Quinn while maintaining her durability.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be cautious of Quinn's ranged attacks in the early game and avoid damage by staying behind minions. Use Q to deal with Mystic and time your W to parry Quinn's skills. As the mid-game approaches, aim for bursts with the E→Q combo and use R to secure vitals, showcasing Fiora's strength. Also, be mindful of ambushes from the bushes, and when Quinn approaches, actively engage to create a favorable situation. Maintaining lane control and activating R are crucial for determining the outcome, so it's important to keep these points in mind while playing."

    "name": "クレッド",
    "beats": {
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has very strong trading abilities in the early game. Kled can aggressively engage Nasus with his W for dashes and burst damage, and since Nasus is weak early on, he can easily be zoned out by Kled's attacks. Additionally, Nasus needs to attack minions to stack his Q, but Kled often denies him that opportunity with his attacks. Furthermore, Kled's CC skills, such as pulling and knockback, restrict Nasus's movement and make it difficult for him to escape.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to set runes and items focused on durability and to avoid early trades. Bringing a Doran's Shield and potions can help increase survivability. Additionally, it is necessary to freeze the minions near your tower to safely stack Q. When Kled charges in, using W to reduce his speed and AD can create an opportunity to counterattack by creating distance. Moreover, while Kled is losing his skull, you can apply pressure confidently and safely stack Q, so be sure not to miss that timing. In the mid to late game, it is crucial to gather items and be aware of your role in team fights.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has high single-target damage and is a very strong champion in one-on-one and small skirmishes. In particular, Kled's all-in with his E is powerful, and Gangplank has limited means to escape, making it difficult when Kled gets close. Additionally, Kled has health return from his passive, allowing him to gain an advantage in sustained fights. Furthermore, Kled's CC skills, such as his pull and knockback, can disrupt Gangplank's ability to time his skills effectively.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play safely in the laning phase and avoid Kled's attacks. Use barrels to harass while securing CS, and try to avoid Kled's all-ins. Buying Ninja Tabi as a first item can effectively reduce Kled's damage. Additionally, completing Trinity Force early can increase both damage output and survivability. It is also important to reach level 13 quickly and participate in team fights to increase the chances of being more impactful than Kled.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Kled's strong dueling ability and durability. Kled is very powerful in duels from early to mid-game, especially when he has Skaarl, which gives him high durability. Yone is highly item-dependent and tends to struggle in prolonged fights against Kled until he gets his items. Additionally, Kled's W skill can negate Yone's attacks, allowing him to avoid direct confrontations. Furthermore, Kled's CC skills (pulls and knockbacks) restrict Yone's movement, making it difficult for him to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Keep the lane closer to your side to make it harder for Kled to attack. Especially in levels 1-3, avoid unnecessarily prolonging 1v1s and focus on poking with Q while stacking.\n2. When Kled charges in, deal damage with E and then retreat immediately to avoid trading blows.\n3. In the mid-game, when Kled's Skaarl is low or he is disengaged, use R to secure a kill.\n4. In terms of item selection, prioritize purchasing Bloodthirster items and Mercury's Treads early to increase kill pressure on Kled. Also, consider items like Bramble Vest or Ninja Tabi as counters to Kled.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Yone's disadvantage and counter Kled effectively.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high single-target damage and mobility that Kled possesses. Kled can initiate short-term attacks from level 2 to 3, particularly applying pressure with the E→Q→AA combo. Cho'Gath needs to endure in the early game, but when taking damage from Kled, he can easily lose Skaarl and find himself in a disadvantageous position during trades. Additionally, Kled's W allows him to dash and avoid Cho'Gath's W (Silence), giving Kled an advantageous position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize minions in the early lane phase and maneuver to avoid direct confrontations. Use E to spam from a distance while aiming for last hits and avoiding Kled's attacks. After level 6, it is crucial to utilize R to aim for kill counts while managing Kled's HP and timing Feast accurately. Additionally, purchasing health and armor-oriented items early can help avoid short engagements, allowing Cho'Gath to withstand Kled's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has high single-target damage and possesses strong traits in one-on-one and small skirmishes. Kled's W, which forces activation, can negate Jax's attacks, allowing Kled to gain an advantage over Jax, especially in auto-attack-focused fights. Additionally, Kled's crowd control skills, such as pulling and knockback, restrict Jax's movement and make it difficult for him to engage. Furthermore, Kled has high lane sustain, which allows him to play favorably against Jax, considering Jax's weakness in the early game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively farm between levels 1-3 and wait for the opponent to make mistakes. Finding opportunities to attack while Kled's W is on cooldown and forcing him to use it to secure CS can be effective. Additionally, purchasing Tiamat early and focusing on roaming after level 6 can help reduce Kled's map pressure. Practicing skill combos and ensuring the flow of Q-auto-W-E can enhance Jax's ability to counter Kled.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has short-term burst potential and mobility, making him particularly strong in early trades. When Gwen takes damage and engages from Kled's W, she may receive significant damage before being able to deal sustained damage. Additionally, Kled's R provides a forceful engage, which is a threat to Gwen. Furthermore, Gwen has a short range, making it difficult to avoid Kled's attacks, and approaching carries risks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted:\n1. In the early lane phase, it's important to use Q to safely farm CS and be cautious of Kled's engage while maintaining distance during harassment.\n2. When Skaarl is present, avoid prolonged fights and focus on healing with minions while minimizing damage taken.\n3. Use E to dodge Kled's engage and look for opportunities to counterattack. It is particularly effective to land a full combo after Kled's R or during the cooldown after his engage.\n4. After level 6, utilize R to negate Kled's engage while dealing sustained damage, allowing you to turn the fight in your favor.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Gwen's disadvantages and gain an advantage in fights.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Kled's powerful melee combat capabilities and sustained damage while mounted. Kled has high durability in his mounted state and can apply pressure on Riven using auto-attacks and skills. Additionally, Kled's W pull and knockback can disrupt Riven's combos, and if Riven is hit by any immobilizing crowd control, she becomes unable to do anything. Furthermore, Kled's ultimate allows for long-range, aggressive engages, making it difficult for Riven to approach.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, Riven should aim for short trades in the early lane phase and utilize her enhanced combos at levels 2/3 to chip away at Kled's mount. It is effective to fully chase down Kled when he dismounts, using R and Flash to deal damage quickly. Additionally, while being cautious of Kled's W, using E to reduce incoming damage and disengaging can help minimize risks. Avoiding prolonged fights and focusing on quick resolutions can help alleviate the disadvantage.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has high burst damage and can deal powerful damage to Shen by repeatedly using Q after charging in with E. While Shen can create distance with E, it is often difficult to avoid Kled's attacks, especially in the early stages of the lane where he is more susceptible to Kled's damage. Additionally, Kled has high sustain, which often puts Shen in unfavorable situations when trying to trade. Furthermore, Kled's ultimate allows for aggressive engages from a distance, making it difficult for Shen to time his R to protect his allies.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to conserve E in the early game and maneuver to avoid Kled's attacks. While aiming for counterattacks with Q, Shen should avoid pushing the minions too much to maintain safe pressure under the tower. Additionally, saving R for counter-ganks and coordinating with the ally jungler to target Kled can help leverage Shen's strengths. In team fights, using R to protect carries and maintain the frontline can reduce the risk of taking damage from Kled.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has high single-target damage and chasing potential, making him very strong in one-on-one and small skirmishes. Kled's full combo of E→Q→W can deal significant damage to K'Sante, and since K'Sante lacks the ability to negate CC, he becomes vulnerable to Kled's attacks. Additionally, Kled has health recovery from his re-mounting ability, allowing him to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range, making it difficult to counter Kled's mobility and approach him.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase defensive items early. Building Steelcaps or Warden's Mail can reduce Kled's damage. When Kled is pushing, using Q Flip or E to swap positions and aim for attacks under the tower can be effective. It is also crucial to use W to dodge Kled's Q and time your counterattack while ignoring CC. Moreover, using your ultimate when Kled is down can prevent his re-mounting and allow you to deal effective damage. By employing these strategies, it is possible to alleviate the disadvantage and turn the fight in your favor.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled can actively trade using his short early-game dash, and especially while Skaarl is present, he can deal strong damage to Ornn. Kled's E→Q→AA combo has high burst damage, making it easy to chip away at Ornn's durability. Additionally, Kled can initiate trades by watching the cooldowns of Ornn's E and W, allowing him to create advantageous situations after Ornn has used his skills. Furthermore, Ornn has low mobility, making it difficult to stop Kled's dashes, which can lead to losing the advantage in close combat.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Ornn to manage minions thoroughly from the early game and maintain distance to avoid Kled's attacks. Placing wards to watch for jungle ganks and keeping track of Kled's movements is also crucial. During trades, Ornn can create a slightly more favorable situation by retaliating after Kled has used his skills. After level 6, Ornn should use his R to disrupt Kled's dashes and focus on fulfilling his role in team fights.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled is strong in prolonged engagements and has high mobility. Kled can leverage his passive health return and skill combos to gain an advantage in extended fights. Additionally, Kled's counterattacks using his W and E make it easier to mitigate Pantheon's burst, especially when Pantheon misses his skills, increasing the risk of being counterattacked. Furthermore, Kled has a powerful charge while mounted, making it difficult for Pantheon to close the gap.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Manage minions in the lane thoroughly to time Kled's skill usage, avoiding unnecessary damage.\n2. After using Pantheon's E, make it a point to disengage quickly to create distance before Kled can counterattack.\n3. Take Ignite as a summoner spell to hinder Kled's healing, allowing for favorable short trades.\n4. Be wary of Kled's R and maintain vision to better predict his charges.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, it is possible to alleviate Pantheon's disadvantage to some extent."
    },
    "loses": {
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage and has high durability in long fights against Kled's short-term burst. Kled aims for burst damage with his W, but Singed can gradually whittle down Kled's health by continuously spreading poison. Additionally, by using Singed's E (Fling), he can move Kled to an unfavorable position, effectively taking away his escape options.\n\nTo take advantage, Singed should first use poison to clear minions in the early lane phase while proxy farming to create an experience lead. Before Kled fully stacks his W, Singed can maintain distance and chip away at Kled's health with poison, and when Kled attacks, he can either swap positions with E to escape or create an opportunity to counterattack. Furthermore, when Kled comes to clear minions, calling for jungle assistance to ambush can create a favorable situation against Kled. In team fights, it is crucial for Singed to disrupt the frontline while spreading poison, ensuring that Kled does not get the chance to target the main carries.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high sustain in 1v1 situations and can deal additional damage while healing herself by hitting her vitals. By parrying Kled's charge with her W, she can negate his attack and create an opportunity for a counterattack. Additionally, when Kled dismounts, he struggles in extended trades, allowing Fiora to aggressively engage and aim for a quick finish.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, use Q between minions to farm vitals while saving W to parry Kled's charge. Use W in guaranteed situations and apply pressure the moment Kled dismounts, chipping away with Q followed by an auto-attack. Considering the enemy's ultimate and the jungle situation, focus on split-pushing in the side lanes after the mid-game, aiming to take down the dismounted Kled in a 1v1. It's important to avoid unnecessary all-ins and to assess the situation carefully.",
      "ケイル": "Kayn is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn becomes stronger as he levels up, and especially after level 6, he becomes Ranged and can deal powerful DPS. Kled is a strong champion in the early game, but if Kayn can survive the early game, he will have overwhelming firepower in the late game. Additionally, Kayn's invulnerability from his R can negate Kled's engage and all-ins, making it easier to avoid Kled's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize CS under the tower safely between levels 1 and 5 and not to force trades. Use Q and E for ranged harassment, and either escape or heal with W while remaining vigilant as long as Skaarl is present. Once you reach level 6, your range and damage increase, so be cautious of Kled's engage while conserving your R for survival. When you reach levels 11 and 16, you can split push near towers and attack from the backline in team fights, allowing you to maneuver advantageously against Kled.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick possesses powerful combat capabilities after scaling, and he can counter Kled, especially with the sheer numbers provided by his Mist Walkers. Kled is a champion that aims for early short engagements, but Yorick can secure healing with his Q and hinder Kled's approach with his W. Additionally, Yorick's R has strong pushing power, excelling at destroying towers and objectives. When Kled attempts an all-in, Yorick can use walls to limit his movements and create advantageous situations with minions.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to secure healing with Q while managing minions at the start of the lane and to mark Kled with E to steal minions. When taking damage from Kled, create a wall with W to mitigate damage by hindering his approach. After the 6-minute mark, level up R to push and utilize your Mist Walkers to gain an advantage in fights before Kled attempts an all-in. Additionally, aiming for jungle intervention and using TP to avoid tower dives while limiting Kled's movements can also be effective.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has range, high base stats, and percentage damage, allowing him to deal consistent damage to Kled. Particularly, the moment Kled loses Skaarl, Urgot gets an opportunity to attack, using E to immobilize him and R to secure the kill. Additionally, Urgot's CC skills make it easier to restrict Kled's movements, giving him an edge in one-on-one encounters.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (levels 1-3), it is important for Urgot to poke with Q while maintaining distance with E to avoid Kled's attacks. When Kled loses Skaarl, Urgot can go all-in with the combo E→W→Q→R to aim for a kill. After level 6, utilizing the instant death effect of R, it is effective to actively engage Kled. Also, if Kled attempts to blink or intervene from the jungle, it is crucial to respond calmly and make the decision to retreat if necessary.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high physical defense and possesses strong engage capabilities, especially against AD champions. Kled can deal powerful damage while mounted, but becomes vulnerable once dismounted. Malphite can safely farm with his E while harassing Kled with his Q, creating opportunities to dismount Kled. Additionally, Malphite's R provides a strong knock-up in team fights, allowing him to stop Kled's charges, thus giving him an advantage in team engagements.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to safely farm with E and harass Kled with Q in the early game. Between levels 3 and 6, be aware of whether Kled is mounted; avoid unnecessary confrontations while he is mounted, and poke him after he dismounts. After level 6, conserve your R to stop enemy charges or multiple opponents, which can help you gain an advantage in team fights. Also, prioritize purchasing armor to increase your durability, allowing you to withstand Kled's attacks.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo possesses high mobility and skills that can be used at no cost, making it easier for him to gain an edge in trades during the laning phase, especially since he can avoid Kled's W (4-hit). Additionally, by using Yasuo's Q (Steel Tempest) to attack while utilizing minions, he can deal short bursts of damage to Kled. Furthermore, Yasuo's R (Last Breath) combo is particularly effective when Kled is dismounted.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid prolonged skirmishes in the early game, conserve W (Wind Wall) with cold trades, and use Q to attack with minions between levels 3 and 6, while using E to maneuver in for short bursts. By being mindful of Kled's W timing and aiming for a knock-up with Q3, you can create favorable situations against Kled. After level 6, you can initiate a full attack using R while positioning yourself to avoid Kled's Wind Wall, allowing you to deal even more damage.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum has high durability and sustained damage, making him particularly strong in prolonged fights. Against Kled's burst damage, Braum can endure by saving his E and healing, making it harder for Kled to exploit openings while dismounted. Additionally, Braum excels at tower pushing and objective control, allowing him to advance the lane favorably.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important not to force trades in the early game, but to focus on minion management to create a level and item lead. To avoid Kled's short-term skirmishes, save your Flash and, when Kled dismounts, maintain distance while using E and healing to endure. Once you have an item lead, you can leverage Braum's tankiness to maintain the frontline in team fights and absorb Kled's attacks.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble can deal sustained magic damage from a distance, and especially with his E (Flamespitter), he can easily zone Kled. Additionally, when Kled does not have his Skarl, Rumble can aggressively engage and suppress Kled's melee combat capabilities. Furthermore, Rumble's R (Missile Barrage) has high area control, which is advantageous in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, at the start of the lane, safely CS minions while slowing Kled with E and dealing sustained damage with Q. In the early game (levels 1-5), it is important to use the minions and bushes to avoid getting close to Kled, continuously chipping away with E→Q. After level 6, while being cautious of Kled's Flash and R, create opportunities to save your own R and call for jungle assistance. In team fights, use your R from the backline to control the area and delay Kled's approach with W, allowing you to evade his charge.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce can utilize his range to poke Kled from a distance. Specifically, by dealing damage to Kled with his Q while saving his E for escape, it becomes easier to prevent Kled from closing the gap. Additionally, since Kled's W is a forced activation, it makes it difficult for Kled to unleash his damage while Jayce maintains his distance.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, it is crucial for Jayce to always maintain his range during the laning phase, continuously dealing damage to Kled with his Q and E. He should look for opportunities to deal burst damage with his W when Kled loses Skaarl or after Kled uses his E to close in. It is also effective to hide behind minions to bait Kled's engage, creating situations where Kled finds it hard to attack. Furthermore, by optimizing his items, Jayce can enhance his range and durability, allowing him to trade favorably against Kled.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and AoE damage, making him strong in team fights and engaging. Sion's CC skills are effective against Kled, especially his R for charging and knocking up, which can limit Kled's movements. Additionally, Sion has a passive that allows him to continue dealing damage for a certain time after death, making it possible to sustain damage in a one-on-one against Kled.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to ensure that Kled cannot push under the tower. The opportunity arises after Kled's second dismount, and you can initiate an attack at that timing. By accurately landing Sion's Q skill, you can enhance harassment against Kled. Maximizing the W skill makes it so that Kled can hardly do anything, so it is effective to enhance W early to increase durability. Furthermore, quickly stacking armor makes it easier to absorb Kled's attacks, and purchasing items like Heartsteel, Jackshow, and Titanic can help you gain an advantage in fights. Using a proxy strategy can also effectively exploit Kled's weakness in wave clearing.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage against Kled, and by approaching while aiming for a stun with her E, she can deal damage while avoiding Kled's W. Additionally, Camille's passive shield increases her durability in short trades, allowing her to absorb Kled's attacks. Furthermore, by using Camille's R to target isolated enemies, she can gain an advantage when Kled loses Skaarl.\n\nTo take advantage, first, safely farm using minions in the early game while being cautious of Kled's W, and engage by creating distance with E. In trades, aim for a stun with E, deal true damage with Q2, and focus on hitting W on the outer edge to chip away at HP. After level 6, it is important to create isolation using R and aim for kills when Skaarl is away. Additionally, securing vision in the jungle and coordinating with teammates can help maintain an advantage in team fights.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high sustain and chasing ability, especially demonstrating powerful healing effects as his HP decreases. While Kled has high single-target damage, he becomes vulnerable when he loses Skaarl and has limited means to escape. Warwick's guaranteed CC from his R can suppress Kled when he charges in, allowing Warwick to gain the upper hand in a brawl. Additionally, Warwick can quickly close the distance and chase Kled while taking his attacks, making it difficult for Kled to utilize his strengths.\n\nTo take advantage, first place a ward before the match to track Kled's movements. In the early game, if Kled charges in, use W to increase your speed and chase him down; if he tries to escape, hide outside the lane and aim for a gank. During the gank, use W to boost your speed, take an angle to charge in with Q, and mitigate damage with E while using R to suppress Kled in a position where he cannot escape. It is crucial to aim for a kill with R immediately when Kled loses Skaarl. In team fights, stopping Kled first can lead to an advantageous situation, so always be aware of his movements.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius can deal sustained damage by stacking bleed, making him particularly strong in long trades. Kled is powerful in short skirmishes, but if Darius can stack his bleed, his sustained damage will surpass Kled's. Additionally, by using Darius's E to pull Kled in, you can create situations where Kled is forced to take damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to harass with Q while stacking bleed in the early game. Avoid short combos, maintain distance with E, and spam Q to aim for 5 stacks. When Kled charges in, aim to finish him off with R, and when Kled is retreating and using his skull, you can confidently initiate an extended fight. Also, by utilizing TP and heal to create a tower advantage, you can set up an even more favorable situation.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has a wide range of hard crowd control and can deal high damage with consecutive attacks. While Kled has high single-target damage, his W, which is central to his playstyle, is forced to activate, making it difficult to retaliate when taking Aatrox's attacks. Additionally, Aatrox's passive healing effect allows him to maintain durability in sustained fights, making it easier to survive Kled's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, it is important to harass with Q while keeping distance and to engage after Kled's W has been activated. Caution is needed while Kled is mounted, but when he dismounts, actively attacking and aiming for a knock-up with E makes it easier to neutralize Kled. Playing near the tower and holding off on attacks until Kled dismounts can reduce risks while creating a favorable situation. Utilizing Bone Plating can mitigate damage taken from Kled's attacks, allowing for a sustained advantage in the lane."

      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Kayle is weak in the early game, she becomes ranged after level 6 and can deal powerful DPS. Illaoi excels in close combat, but she is vulnerable to Kayle's harassment and slow effects from her skills. Additionally, Kayle's ultimate, which grants invulnerability, can easily negate Illaoi's attacks, and especially in team fights, if Kayle gets ahead, Illaoi often gets overwhelmed.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively place tentacles in the early game, push the wave, and pressure Kayle. Earning tentacle damage through short trades before level 6 and focusing on sustain can make it harder to receive harassment from Kayle. Also, being aware of Kayle's ultimate and not forcing attacks while saving your own ultimate when necessary can help avoid her powerful attacks. Furthermore, while relying on jungle support, farming while keeping distance after level 6 and deploying tentacles to maintain the frontline in team fights is effective.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle becomes capable of ranged attacks after level 6, allowing her to deal powerful DPS. Singed is a melee champion and cannot deal damage without getting close, making him very vulnerable to Kayle's range. Additionally, when Kayle uses her ultimate, it creates a state of invulnerability that negates Singed's sustained damage. Furthermore, Kayle can use skills with slow effects to restrict Singed's movement, making it difficult for him to approach.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to utilize proxy farming in the early game to create a difference in experience and minions, putting pressure on Kayle. Also, provoking Kayle's ultimate before she reaches level 6 and then attacking can create an opportunity to negate her invulnerability. Moreover, in team fights, prioritizing durability and targeting Kayle's backline can help leverage Singed's strengths.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle can apply strong harassment and all-ins against Braum, who is very weak in the early game, before level 6, making it easier for Kayle to gain an advantage. However, after reaching level 6, Kayle becomes ranged and can deal powerful DPS, causing Braum to lose his advantage in close combat. Additionally, Kayle's slow effect skills make it difficult for Braum to approach, and especially in team fights or battles under towers, caution is needed against Kayle's late-game damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively trade in the early game to create a health difference. If you can harass Kayle before she reaches level 6 and force her to use her Flash, it will make it easier to aim for all-ins later on. In terms of item selection, focusing on mobility and burst damage while ensuring durability by choosing items like Stridebreaker or Sterak's Gage is advisable. Furthermore, using wards to manage bushes and keep track of Kayle's movements can help you gain an advantage in close combat.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle has strong attack power from level 1, and especially after level 6, she becomes ranged and can deal significant DPS. Gwen is a melee champion with a short range, making her susceptible to Kayle's attacks, and she finds herself in a very difficult situation until she reaches level 6. Additionally, when Kayle uses her ultimate to become invulnerable, it becomes challenging for Gwen to land her attacks. Furthermore, Gwen lacks hard crowd control, making her vulnerable to Kayle's slow effects.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to pull the wave to your side and apply pressure before Kayle reaches level 6. Taking advantage of Gwen's ultimate cooldown to go for an early all-in can also be effective. Additionally, purchasing \"Zhonya's Hourglass\" as a second item makes it easier to avoid Kayle's ultimate and improves survivability in fights. Moreover, after Kayle acquires \"Swift Shoes,\" it becomes difficult to chase her, so trading when you can use your W and gradually whittling down her HP is a viable strategy.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle becomes ranged after level 6 and can deal powerful DPS, making it difficult for Garen to approach. In particular, Kayle can use her slow-effect skills to hinder Garen's movements, making it hard for him to avoid attacks. Additionally, Kayle becomes stronger as she levels up, and especially after level 16, she can fight in a very powerful state, making it difficult for Garen to win in a one-on-one. Furthermore, Garen lacks hard CC and has a hard time dealing with Kayle's invulnerability from her ultimate.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Avoid level 16 Kayle**: Aim to end the game early and establish an advantage before Kayle can grow.\n2. **Seek jungle support**: Requesting ganks from the jungler to take down Kayle early can apply pressure in the lane.\n3. **Push the wave**: Maintaining the wave under your tower can prevent Kayle from free farming and suppress her growth.\n4. **Focus on short trades**: Engage in short trades at early levels to force Kayle to use her skills before counterattacking, increasing your chances to deal damage.\n5. **Utilize Q and E combo**: Silence Kayle with Q and deal damage with E to prevent her from retaliating.\n6. **Be creative with item builds**: Prioritize purchasing items that can counter Kayle, such as Stridebreaker or Collector.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Garen can mitigate his disadvantage against Kayle and fight more favorably.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Kayle is weak in the early game, she becomes a powerful ranged carry with strong damage output after level 6. Kayle acquires her ultimate at level 6, allowing her to create an invulnerable state, making it easier to avoid Rumble's attacks. Additionally, Kayle has slows, which can limit Rumble's mobility and allow her to attack while maintaining distance. Furthermore, Rumble lacks hard crowd control, making it difficult to deal with the highly mobile Kayle, often resulting in unfavorable one-on-one situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use E to keep distance and cross minions while harassing with Q in the early game. Also, around level 6, it is effective to avoid risky all-ins and push during the time when Kayle's damage is low with short bursts. In the mid-game, focus on using R to control areas and disrupt Kayle's farming route. In the late game, as Kayle becomes stronger, it is crucial to coordinate with teammates to engage with R.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle becomes ranged after level 6 and can deal powerful DPS. While Urgot is strong in early skirmishes, the risk of taking damage from Kayle increases as levels rise. In particular, Urgot has a hard time dealing with Kayle's ultimate, which grants her invulnerability, leading to a lower win rate in one-on-one encounters. Additionally, Kayle can use skills with slow effects to hinder Urgot's approach, making it easier to avoid his attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play the lane cautiously in the early game and prioritize farming behind minions. Urgot is strong in the first three levels, but it is necessary to apply pressure early to prevent Kayle from growing. Also, utilizing bushes to increase the chances of landing E and engaging in short trades can help accumulate damage. After level 6, while being mindful of Kayle's ultimate, creating off-angles with hooks and wards to aim for solo kills is effective. Furthermore, considering the purchase of Bramble-type items can help suppress Kayle's healing.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle becomes ranged after level 6 and can deal powerful DPS, allowing her to attack while safely maintaining distance from K'Sante's melee attacks. Additionally, Kayle can use skills with slow effects to hinder K'Sante's movements, and especially in the early game, K'Sante has a short range and is vulnerable to Kayle's harassment. Furthermore, while K'Sante has strength in an all-out state, Kayle's ultimate, which grants invulnerability, can likely negate K'Sante's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to leverage early game strength to gain an advantage quickly. Freezing the minion wave creates a situation where Kayle cannot harass, making it easier to invite jungle ganks. Additionally, purchasing Bramble early and aiming for Ninja Tabi or Sterak's Gage can help reduce Kayle's damage. In terms of rune selection, considering Second Wind or Aftershock and being aware of the level 6 power spike is crucial. Emphasizing teamwork and hoping for victories in other lanes, while also eliminating the enemy ADC with your ultimate, is also part of the strategy.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle becomes ranged after level 6 and can deal powerful DPS. This strength becomes particularly evident after level 11, making it difficult for Gangplank's harassment and burst damage to land effectively. Additionally, Kayle can use skills with slow effects to hinder Gangplank's movement, and her ultimate creates an invulnerable state, making it easier for her to avoid Gangplank's attacks. Furthermore, Gangplank has low base stats, and if he falls behind early, it becomes challenging to recover, leading to a very tough situation if Kayle is allowed to grow.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, first, focus on wave management and maintain a freeze to prevent Kayle from safely farming. It's also important to buy Executioner's Calling as the first item and continue poking with Q to prevent her from healing. Aim to take a lead before Kayle levels up by actively harassing her and maintaining a CS lead. Additionally, use TP for dragon plays, either to attack with full damage or to zone, allowing for a favorable position in team fights.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Kayle is weak in the early game, she becomes ranged after level 6 and can deal powerful DPS, making it difficult for Set to approach and engage in melee combat. Additionally, Kayle can use skills with slow effects to hinder Set's movement, especially after level 6, making it harder for Set to close the gap. Furthermore, Kayle has an ultimate that creates an invulnerable state, which increases the likelihood of avoiding Set's attacks, putting him at a disadvantage in trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to deny Kayle experience between levels 1-5. Delaying her XP, even at the cost of minions, aims to establish an advantage before she reaches level 6. Starting with E and actively engaging before Kayle enters the XP range is effective. Choosing Ghost or Flash and quickly purchasing Swift Boots to increase movement speed will help Set get closer to Kayle. Additionally, pushing the wave and freezing it in front of the tower can effectively keep Kayle away from the minions. Finally, it is crucial to ward the river and remain vigilant against ganks.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Kayle becomes ranged and can deal powerful DPS, making it difficult for Renekton to create advantageous situations when attacking in melee. Particularly, Kayle is further enhanced after level 11, increasing her ability to deal sustained damage. Additionally, Kayle's skills with slow effects hinder Renekton's approach, making trades more challenging. Furthermore, Kayle has an ultimate that creates an invulnerable state, making it highly likely that Renekton's attacks will be avoided, especially in team fights where this impact is pronounced.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial for Renekton to play aggressively before level 6 and overwhelm Kayle. By controlling the wave and creating situations where Kayle struggles to farm, her growth can be delayed. It is also important to leverage Renekton's Q for healing while using W and E to gain an advantage in trades. After level 6, being aware of Kayle's ultimate and coordinating attacks with other champions in team fights can help mitigate Kayle's strengths.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremdamer is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle becomes ranged after level 6 and is a carry-type champion with strong sustained damage. Early game Trundle is powerful, but Kayle becomes stronger as she levels up, especially after level 16 when she becomes very strong. Additionally, Kayle can create an invulnerable state with her ultimate (R), which can negate Trundle's attacks. Furthermore, Trundle is weak against CC, and being hit by Kayle's slow (W) can restrict his movement and make it difficult for him to attack.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Play cautiously in the early game and actively zone to delay Kayle's level up.\n2. Use E to maintain distance while farming CS to avoid Kayle's skills.\n3. Don't save the ultimate (R) and look for opportunities to attack when Kayle's ultimate is on cooldown.\n4. Push the minions quickly to apply pressure with roams or tower damage before Kayle can scale.\n5. In the late game, be mindful of timeline management in team fights and coordinate with allies to target Kayle.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Kayle is weak in the early game, she becomes significantly stronger after level 6 and is a carry-type champion with ranged attacks. Cho'Gath is a melee champion and can play favorably between levels 1 and 5, but once Kayle reaches level 6, her DPS increases dramatically, making Cho'Gath vulnerable to ranged attacks. Additionally, if Kayle uses her ultimate to grant herself invulnerability, it can negate Cho'Gath's crowd control, rendering his attacks ineffective and putting him in a very difficult situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to leverage early harassment to reach level 6 as quickly as possible and prevent Kayle's growth. Securing vision and keeping track of Kayle's movements will help in timing when to force her to use her ultimate. As for items, purchasing greater magic resistance, health, and anti-healing items (like Bramble Vest) can be effective in reducing Kayle's damage output in prolonged fights. Furthermore, in team fights, it is advisable to either wait for Kayle's ultimate to expire or focus on using crowd control to peel her away.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle's range increases after level 6, allowing her to deal powerful DPS. Teemo has an advantage in the early game, but as Kayle levels up, Teemo's blind effect becomes less effective against her, especially since Kayle's R (invulnerability) can negate Teemo's attacks. Additionally, Kayle has strong scaling and is very powerful as a carry in team fights. Teemo has low durability in team fights, making it difficult to counter Kayle's growth.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively poke from the early game and disrupt Kayle's CS. Teemo can use his Q (blind) to negate Kayle's auto-attacks and deal continuous damage with his E (damage over time). Furthermore, placing mushrooms to secure vision and limit Kayle's movements can help maintain a favorable situation for Teemo. After level 6, it is crucial to avoid overcommitting and focus on split pushing or taking objectives on the map to suppress Kayle's growth.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Fiora can create advantageous situations against Kayle in the early game, after level 6, Kayle gains range and can deal powerful DPS, making it difficult for Fiora to approach. In particular, if Kayle uses her R (invulnerability), Fiora's attacks are nullified, increasing the risk of counterattacks. Additionally, Fiora lacks hard CC, making her vulnerable to Kayle's slow effects, and it becomes challenging to attack if she maintains her distance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Fiora to leverage her strengths in the early game by engaging in short trades to chip away at Kayle's HP. Specifically, using W (Riposte) to parry Kayle's Q or auto-attacks while dealing damage and healing can be effective. Furthermore, after level 6, it is crucial not to engage head-on but to act while checking Kayle's R cooldown. Utilizing split-pushing to destroy towers can also apply pressure and create situations where Kayle cannot participate in team fights.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Kayle becomes ranged and can deal sustained damage, allowing her to maneuver advantageously against Shen's melee attacks. Specifically, while Shen can apply pressure in the early game, once Kayle reaches level 6, the difference in range and her scaling strength causes Shen to lose his advantage in close combat. Additionally, Kayle's W provides healing and acceleration, which helps her mitigate Shen's attacks. Furthermore, Shen lacks hard crowd control, making him vulnerable to Kayle's slows and poke.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points should be considered. First, it is important to actively pressure Kayle between levels 1 and 5 to establish an early CS lead. By conserving E and looking for kill opportunities, Shen can create favorable situations against Kayle. Additionally, after level 6, it is effective to avoid chasing Kayle unnecessarily and prioritize roaming to intervene in other lanes, increasing overall map pressure. Securing vision and being cautious of enemy jungle movements is also crucial to suppress Kayle's growth."

    "loses": {
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has strong attack power from the early game and can apply pressure on Kayle until she reaches level 6. Kayle is very weak in the early game, especially between levels 1 and 5, making her vulnerable to other champions. Irelia can increase her attack speed with her Q and use her E to blink, making it easier to approach Kayle and gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, by using Irelia's W, which has a stun effect, she can neutralize Kayle's skills and increase her chances of dealing damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively pressure Kayle between levels 1 and 5, aiming for kills or stealing summoner spells. Manage the minion wave and use Q resets to secure sustain while targeting the timing when Kayle's skills are on cooldown to attack with the E→Q→AA combo. After level 6, be cautious of Kayle's ultimate, avoid high-risk prolonged confrontations, and aim for pressure in side lanes and roaming to maintain overall map control while creating advantageous situations.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, allowing him to exploit Kayle's early weakness. Kayle is very vulnerable until she reaches level 6, especially since her base stats as a melee champion are low, making it difficult for her to withstand Gragas's harassment and all-ins. Additionally, by using Gragas's Q (Barrel) to apply a slow, it restricts Kayle's movement and makes it easier to land attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively harass from the early game and chip away at Kayle's health. After dealing damage with Gragas's W (Burst), you can close the gap with E (Body Slam) and apply a slow with Q (Barrel) to create a favorable situation against Kayle. Moreover, if you can establish a solid lead before Kayle reaches level 6, it becomes easier to maintain lane dominance. Furthermore, consider using Gragas's R (Drunken Rage) to negate Kayle's Ult (invulnerability) during team fights or all-ins.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has skills that enhance his basic attacks, making him particularly good at a playstyle that relies on auto-attacks (AA). Kayle is very weak in the early game and remains at a disadvantage against other champions until she reaches level 6. After level 3, Jax can exploit Kayle's weaknesses by aggressively attacking her. Even after level 6, when Kayle becomes ranged, Jax can mitigate her attacks by purchasing Swift Shoes to avoid her slows.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to attack at level 3. At this timing, actively harassing Kayle and preventing her from getting close to minions can hinder her growth. Additionally, buying Swift Shoes early allows Jax to avoid Kayle's slows, enabling him to continue attacking more safely. Furthermore, by managing the lane effectively and preventing Kayle from farming, Jax can maintain his superiority.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has strong engage capabilities against Kayle, especially in the early game before level 6, where he can harass while farming minions with his Q without taking damage from Kayle. Kayle is very weak in the early game and is vulnerable to Malphite's attacks until she reaches level 6. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense, making him strong against AD champions, allowing him to withstand Kayle's attacks more easily.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important not to approach recklessly and to prioritize CS with E while farming minions with Q. Be careful not to take harassment from Kayle before reaching level 6, and it is crucial to chip away at her while defending with W. After level 6, Kayle's ultimate increases her range, so coordinating with the jungle to aim for a full combo of Flash + R to prioritize Kayle is effective. For item selection, choosing items like Sunfire, Frozen Heart, or Thornmail to counter AD/AS will allow you to play favorably against Kayle. In team fights, using R proactively to lock down the enemy carry and bursting Kayle as a top priority will be the key to victory.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility in the early game and can apply pressure on Kayle. Especially between levels 1 and 5, Kayle is very weak, allowing Anbessa to poke with Q and E while dealing damage to both minions and Kayle. Additionally, Anbessa's skills include a dash, enabling him to avoid Kayle's attacks while engaging.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to poke Kayle with Q and E in the early game to build up passive. Using W to reduce damage taken, Anbessa can recover energy with short dashes and auto-attacks while applying kill pressure to push Kayle before level 6. Particularly, checking for the presence of Flash and ambushing in the side bushes can create a favorable situation against Kayle. After level 6, focusing on avoiding Kayle's R while roaming or side-pushing to create a tower advantage can lead to an even more favorable outcome.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce can attack from a distance from level 1 and can poke Kayle using his Q. Kayle is very weak in the early game, especially until she reaches level 6, when her damage output is low, making it difficult for her to counter Jayce's ranged attacks. Additionally, Jayce has knockback and snare abilities, which can prevent Kayle from getting close.\n\nTo take advantage, you should deal damage to Kayle with your Q while pushing the minions to control the lane from the start until level 6. Avoid the enemy's Q with sidesteps while conserving potions to sustain. Once you reach level 6, it's important to time your aggressive moves carefully to capitalize on your strong burst damage to take down Kayle. Additionally, gathering items early to secure mobility and damage can create an even more advantageous situation. Roaming and applying pressure to other lanes can also effectively enhance overall map control.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven's strengths lie in her early burst damage and mobility, allowing her to apply pressure on Kayle from an early stage. Especially between levels 1 and 5, Kayle is still weak and has a short auto-attack range, so Riven can poke Kayle while farming with a combo of Q and auto-attacks. Additionally, Riven can close the gap using her E and deal significant damage with a full combo (Q → W → auto-attack), making it easier to aim for a kill before level 6.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, avoid overextending outside of Kayle's auto-attack range and gradually chip away at her health using Q and auto-attacks. Before reaching level 6, use all of Riven's skills and aim for an all-in while being mindful of Kayle's heal and teleport. After level 6, while paying attention to Kayle's ranged attacks, use Riven's ultimate to create guaranteed kill opportunities and coordinate tower dives with your jungler.\n\nIn the mid to late game, you can side push and roam, building your items and stacking durability, allowing you to dive into team fights and target carries. It's also important to utilize Riven's mobility to counterattack when Kayle's skill cooldowns are down.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and burst damage, making it easy to apply pressure on Kayle, especially in the early game. Kayle is very weak in the early game, has low damage output until she reaches level 6, and struggles to deal with high-mobility champions like Quinn. Additionally, by utilizing Quinn's E slow effect, you can limit Kayle's movement while harassing her with Q, securing lane dominance.\n\nTo take advantage, first zone Kayle during the first three waves to prevent her from getting CS. Harass with Quinn's Q and position yourself so that Kayle cannot approach. After level 6, it is important to use Quinn's ultimate to roam and look for ganks, impacting other lanes while continuing to apply pressure on Kayle. Also, by using E appropriately to dodge Kayle's skills and cancel her attacks, you can fight without taking damage.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high damage from early to mid-game, and Kayle is very weak until she reaches level 6, allowing Yasuo to actively engage in trades. Yasuo can use his E to flank and spam Q to apply pressure on Kayle, making it easier to disrupt her farming. Additionally, Yasuo's W can block Kayle's ranged attacks, giving him an advantage when she tries to engage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Yasuo to actively trade and disrupt Kayle's farming from the start until level 5. Specifically, after enhancing his abilities at level 2, he should approach with E and spam Q to deal damage while dodging Kayle's skills. After level 6, it is effective to be cautious of Kayle's R while using ally CC to go for an all-in. Furthermore, progressing from PD to IE will increase damage and apply stronger pressure on Kayle.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle is very weak in the early game, especially until she reaches level 6, when her attack power and durability are low, allowing Yone to exploit that gap. Yone is an auto-attack-based fighter who can deal high DPS by utilizing his skills, making it possible for him to aggressively attack during Kayle's weak phase. Additionally, before Kayle transitions to ranged, Yone has the advantage in close combat.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from level 1 to 2, use Q and E in quick succession against Kayle while managing minions to apply pressure. Between levels 3 and 5, before Kayle's range increases, use Blade Surge (Q→E→W) to attack while avoiding Kayle's skills and dealing damage. After level 6, caution is needed due to Kayle's ultimate, but it's important to check cooldowns and use R to engage when her ultimate is unavailable, aiming for a kill.\n\nIn the mid-game, prioritize towers and roaming, as Kayle is strong in team fights, so creating 1v1 situations will be key to victory. In the late game, be aware that you could be turned around due to item differences, so focus on expanding your advantage early and ending the game.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has sustain from the early game and can apply pressure in short trades. Kayle is very weak until level 6, and especially in the early game, she is vulnerable to Bloodmire's attacks. By utilizing the damage and healing effect of Bloodmire's Q while avoiding Kayle's ranged auto-attacks, he can gain an advantage over her. Additionally, using Bloodmire's W for its invulnerability effect makes it easier to avoid Kayle's burst damage, allowing for sustained damage in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Bloodmire should use Q to clear minions while maintaining pressure on Kayle with W for healing. It's important to establish a lead before reaching level 6. After level 6, he should conserve his R and look for the right timing to deal damage in response to Kayle's heal or escape. In the mid-game and beyond, utilizing roams and vision to take the initiative in team fights before Kayle can complete her items can create an even more advantageous situation.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has powerful burst damage from the early game and can apply pressure during Kayle's weak phase before she reaches level 6. By using Camille's E to engage while crossing walls, she can harass Kayle with Q and auto-attacks, disrupting her farm while dealing damage. Additionally, Camille can isolate Kayle with her R, which has a stun effect, allowing her to secure kills reliably.\n\nTo take advantage, first, push the minions from levels 1 to 5 to apply pressure, and when Kayle is isolated, catch her with E→R for a guaranteed kill. After level 6, since Kayle gains ranged attacks, it’s important not to force an all-in but to use roaming and tower pressure to widen the gap. Also, being aware of Kayle's ultimate and timing your engages will be key to victory.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank and excels at lane sustain. Kayle is very weak in the early game and finds it difficult to play aggressively against Ornn until she reaches level 6, allowing Ornn to deal damage during that time. Additionally, Ornn's skills have crowd control (CC) that can limit Kayle's movements. In particular, Ornn's R (ultimate) knock-up creates opportunities to deal damage before Kayle becomes invulnerable.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively harass Kayle from the early game, earning CS (creep score) while dealing damage before reaching level 6. Harassing with Ornn's Q (Flame Spike), maintaining durability with W (Scarlet Shield), and closing in with E (Shift) to continue dealing damage is effective. Furthermore, even after Kayle reaches level 6, using Ornn's R to engage in team fights can help maintain an advantage against Kayle."

      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy excels at preventing dashes and leaps, particularly by nullifying Renekton's E (dash), which greatly limits his mobility. Additionally, Poppy's crowd control (stun) and high shield make it difficult for Renekton to trade effectively. Furthermore, Poppy has strong one-on-one capabilities and can retaliate while taking Renekton's attacks, often putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to stand parallel to the wall to make it easier to avoid Poppy's attacks and to actively engage using Q. Maximizing W to increase damage and avoiding getting too close to Poppy's buckler can also reduce risks. By cleverly using E and predicting Poppy's actions to dash, you can gain an advantage in the psychological battle. Choosing toughness runes can also be effective in withstanding Poppy's E stun. Focusing on farming, playing safely until level 6, and looking for opportunities to break Poppy's shield are also crucial.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy has high durability and possesses a W that can negate dashes and an E that can stun enemies against walls. This can effectively nullify Pantheon's short-term burst damage. Additionally, Poppy can showcase her strength by dragging the fight into a prolonged engagement, meaning that if Pantheon cannot establish an early advantage, he will face increasing disadvantages in the late game. Furthermore, Poppy's skills have short range, making it difficult for Pantheon to maintain distance, which can lead to unfavorable trades in close combat.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Be mindful of trading in the early lane, and attack after provoking Poppy's E to waste her skill.\n2. Use minions to creatively position yourself and be cautious not to get pinned against walls.\n3. If kills are not achievable, utilize roaming to apply pressure in other lanes and build overall advantage.\n4. Adjust the item build to increase durability, allowing Pantheon to withstand close encounters with Poppy.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy excels at preventing dashes and leaps, particularly nullifying Nar's skills that enhance his mobility. Poppy's E (Breakdown) stun poses a significant threat when Nar attempts an all-in. Additionally, Poppy's short skill range makes it difficult for Nar to avoid her attacks while harassing in mini form. Furthermore, Poppy has tanky durability, making it easier for her to absorb Nar's damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Maintain distance**: It is crucial to always keep a distance to avoid Poppy's attacks and to act cautiously when harassing.\n\n2. **Manage transformation timing**: Be mindful of when to transform into Mega Nar, aiming to create advantageous situations during fights with Poppy. Particularly, look for opportunities to use Mega Nar's CC to pin Poppy against a wall.\n\n3. **Item build adjustments**: Purchase \"Trinity Force\" early to increase damage output, enhancing the ability to counter Poppy. Additionally, selecting defensive items to withstand Poppy's attacks is important.\n\n4. **Role in team fights**: In team fights, focus on targeting the backline and aim to break Poppy's frontline. Coordinating with teammates to neutralize Poppy will be key to achieving victory.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy has strong crowd control (stun) at close range and can approach while avoiding Jayce's ranged attacks. In particular, when Poppy uses her E (wall stun), Jayce becomes vulnerable to being engaged and countered. Additionally, Poppy has high durability as a tank, making it difficult for Jayce's burst damage to be effective. Furthermore, Poppy excels at initiating short skirmishes in lane, and even if Jayce tries to maintain distance, he can quickly find himself in a disadvantageous situation due to Poppy's crowd control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on poking in the early lane phase and use minions as a shield to avoid Poppy's attacks. Timing counterattacks after Poppy uses her E to exploit her cooldowns can also be effective. Moreover, placing more wards in the side lanes is crucial to prevent Poppy from using walls to close the gap. In team fights, positioning as a support from the backline and avoiding Poppy's crowd control can help alleviate her strengths.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy has a strong counter against champions with dashes and leaps, and particularly, Ornn's skills have low mobility, making it difficult to avoid Poppy's CC. When Ornn gets hit by Poppy's Q or W, he is susceptible to damage, especially when Poppy's R stuns him, resulting in significant damage. Additionally, while Poppy's skills have short range, Ornn's skills require preparation, making it hard to deal with Poppy's mobility. Furthermore, Poppy has low cooldown percentage damage, which can easily chip away at Ornn's tankiness.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to act cautiously and prioritize farming. You can bait Poppy's W by pretending to use E or using E in the opposite direction to waste Poppy's skills. Also, be careful not to get hit by Poppy's Q2, and by timing your W correctly, you can stop Poppy's R. By pushing the lane, you can secure safety while being mindful of jungle ganks, and it is crucial not to force a lane win but to farm safely and focus on scaling.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy has a W that can block dashes, significantly limiting Riven's mobility. Riven has many skills that involve movement, making her vulnerable to Poppy's CC, especially the wall stun from E and the separation from R. Additionally, Poppy has high durability as a tank, making it easier for her to absorb Riven's burst damage, which puts Riven at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Poppy's skill range is short, so when Riven approaches, if Poppy uses W, the risk of Riven's attack being canceled increases.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, from levels 1 to 2, do not force attacks and prioritize CS while being cautious of Poppy's W. After provoking W, it is important to check the cooldown and deal damage with a short combo (Q + AA + W return). Also, manage the minions to keep them frozen, making it difficult for Poppy to hit the wall with E. From levels 3 to 6, utilize skill rotations to aim for a quick finish, using R when Poppy's W is down or when she is in a bad position. Post level 6, be cautious of the escape risk from Poppy's R, avoid unnecessary chases, and focus on leveraging advantages in side lanes or roaming. In terms of item builds, Riven should prioritize damage and CDR, while Poppy should purchase tank-oriented items early for effectiveness.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy's W, which disrupts dashes, and E, which stuns through terrain, greatly limit Anbessa's mobility. Poppy can effectively counter enemies with dashes and leaps, making it easy for her to negate Anbessa's skills, especially in close trades. Additionally, Poppy has high shields and crowd control, allowing her to gain an advantage in one-on-one combat.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early game, build up passive charges with minions while using E→Q to poke from outside Poppy's W range. Timing your attacks when Poppy's W is on cooldown is effective. Also, maneuvering to avoid Poppy's E stun by utilizing terrain and being cautious when approaching is necessary. In the mid to late game, securing vision and coordinating with allies to target the backline can help reduce Poppy's impact while fighting.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy has skills that can disrupt dashes and leaps, particularly by nullifying Jax's E (Leap), which limits Jax's mobility. Additionally, Poppy's W (Shield) makes Jax susceptible to damage during short trades, and when harassed by Poppy's E-Q-W combo, it becomes difficult for Jax to retaliate. Furthermore, Poppy has the ability to stun enemies by slamming them against walls, increasing the risk for Jax when trying to approach. In prolonged fights, Jax has the advantage, but if Poppy gains a lead, Jax will have to prioritize farming, making it hard to aim for kills.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, a strategy of baiting out Poppy's W before attacking is effective. It is important to refrain from attacking while Poppy's W is active and to avoid short trades. Additionally, using E at level 1 to take the initiative and avoiding standing near walls can help evade Poppy's dashes. In terms of item selection, starting with a Doran's Blade and two health potions, and purchasing Mercurial Boots early is recommended to enhance mobility. Furthermore, rushing to build a Rageblade is also important to increase damage against tank opponents.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy can disrupt Nasus's Q stacking with early harassment and wall stun (E). Poppy's W prevents Nasus from dashing, making it difficult for him to engage and leaving him vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, Poppy has low cooldown percentage damage and a high shield, allowing her to often secure advantageous trades before Nasus can scale.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize Q farming without forcing attacks in the early game. If pushed against a wall by Poppy's E, it is necessary to immediately use W to reduce movement speed and create distance. Furthermore, purchasing items that focus on HP and armor early on is essential to withstand the opponent's harassment. While being cautious of ganks, it is crucial to draw the minion wave to the tower to buy time for stacking Q. In the mid-game, prioritize splitting with Q, and when allies arrive, use W to lock down key targets and R in fights to increase your impact in team battles.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy excels at preventing dashes and leaps, and if Gragas's movement using his E is restricted, trades become very unfavorable. Additionally, Poppy's W nullifies Gragas's dashes, making it difficult to maintain distance from her. Furthermore, Poppy has a high shield and low cooldown percentage damage, allowing her to gain an advantage in one-on-one combat against Gragas. Gragas has a slow skill activation, especially with the charge time of his Q, making him susceptible to Poppy's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on minion management and position yourself to avoid entering the range of Poppy's W. Look for opportunities to trade when Poppy's E and W are on cooldown by using E→Q→AA. Additionally, using your R to push Poppy away from walls or towards your allies can help you avoid her E's stun. In the later stages of the lane, it is crucial not to engage recklessly but to use your R to create separation or have escape options. Regarding your build, opting for an AP-oriented build that emphasizes wave control and burst damage can increase your means to counter Poppy.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy excels at preventing dashes and leaps, and she can potentially stop Sion's R with her W. Sion has a slow skill activation, making it difficult to hit the highly mobile Poppy. Additionally, if Poppy uses her E to pin Sion against a wall, he will take significant damage, making it hard to maneuver. Furthermore, Poppy has strong 1v1 combat capabilities and possesses burst damage that surpasses Sion's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm while avoiding Poppy's Q and E in the early game and not to engage recklessly. Applying pressure with Sion's Q and E can be effective to prevent Poppy from saving her W. In team fights, it is advisable to act as a tank on the front line, being mindful of your teammates' support while trying to avoid Poppy's skills.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy's E stun and W dash disruption are very powerful, limiting Yone's mobility. In particular, if Yone tries to attack from outside the range of Poppy's W with E, he is more susceptible to Poppy's counterattack. Additionally, Poppy has high durability as a tank, making it easier for her to absorb Yone's attacks. Furthermore, Poppy's R (Keeper's Verdict) push also hinders Yone's approach to the backline.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early game, it is important to maintain distance to avoid Poppy's E stun, farm with Q, and engage in small trades.\n2. Always be aware of the range of Poppy's W and carefully choose the timing to use E to avoid dash disruption.\n3. After level 6, using R to split Poppy can create opportunities to target the backline.\n4. In terms of item build, purchasing boots early and utilizing lifesteal to gain an advantage in prolonged fights is crucial.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy can effectively counter enemies with dashes and leaps, limiting K'Sante's engage and mobility. In particular, Poppy's Q deals high damage and consumes mana, which can make it difficult for K'Sante to manage his resources. Additionally, Poppy has a wealth of crowd control skills, and her ability to stun by slamming into walls poses a threat to K'Sante. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range and often finds himself in situations where he is vulnerable to Poppy's attacks, making trades in the lane unfavorable.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play cautiously until reaching level 6, luring Poppy's Q to farm safely under the tower. It is also effective to bait Poppy's W and look for the right timing to counterattack with your ultimate. Additionally, creatively building items to increase durability can help reduce Poppy's damage and improve K'Sante's one-on-one performance. Strengthening coordination with teammates and fulfilling his role in team fights can also help turn the matchup against Poppy in K'Sante's favor."

    "loses": {
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has area-of-effect continuous magic damage, allowing him to deal high damage to Poppy in a short period. In particular, by using Rumble's W, he can restrict Poppy's movement and control the zone. Additionally, Rumble has no skill costs and short cooldowns, enabling him to frequently use his skills to pressure Poppy.\n\nTo take advantage, first, engage in mini-trades between levels 1 and 3, combining E and Q to deal continuous damage. It is important to burn the ground to create escape routes and avoid provoking Poppy's charge. After level 6, use R to create a zone at the forefront of team fights, preventing Poppy from getting close. In team fights, effectively use R and both Qs and E from the backline to maintain continuous damage and restrict Poppy's movements. By maneuvering to avoid allowing Poppy's charge and creating isolation, you can gain the upper hand.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius excels in long trades and can deal sustained damage through his passive, Hemorrhage. Poppy is a short-range tank, and when she takes Darius's attacks, she is prone to accumulating damage, especially in situations where Darius's Q healing effect comes into play. Additionally, Darius can easily position himself to avoid Poppy's crowd control, and after pulling her in with his E, he can execute a Q combo to engage in favorable trades against Poppy.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, trade with minions using Q while dealing damage with the W→Q→AA combo. It is important to be cautious of Poppy's E and avoid fighting near walls. By using E to pull Poppy in and dealing damage while avoiding her stun, you can create a sustained advantageous situation. Furthermore, managing the wave and creating a situation where jungle interference is minimized will allow Darius to leverage his strengths more effectively. In the late game, aim to use R to act as a finisher in team fights and maximize damage output.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum excels in close combat, particularly in brawls. He can close the gap with his Q and aim for a stun, while using his W to heal and deal sustained damage. Additionally, Braum's R is useful for chasing down enemies and disrupting their formation, making a strong impact in team fights. On the other hand, Poppy is excellent at disrupting dashes and leaps, but she tends to lose damage output when taking hits from Braum, especially when kept at a distance.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, be mindful of cooldown management from the start and check for Poppy's E and W. In the early lane phase, after forcing Poppy to use her E, approach with Q and deal damage while healing with AA→W. During trades, aim for a stun with Q, heal with AA→W, and secure a shield with E. When reaching level 6, it's crucial to use R to launch a strong attack and break Poppy's stance. In team fights, while sustaining with W, attack the main target with R, and it's effective to engage when Poppy's E/W are on cooldown.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes Ranged after level 6 and can deal powerful DPS, allowing her to maneuver advantageously against Poppy's close combat. Poppy is strong in the early game and excels in close trades, but Kail becomes stronger as she levels up, especially after level 6 when she has an R that creates an invulnerable state, making it easier to avoid Poppy's attacks. Additionally, Kail can use slows to maintain distance while attacking, allowing her to evade Poppy's charges and knockbacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important not to force aggression in the early game and to safely farm minions. Use potions and wards to ensure safety, avoid Poppy's attacks while expanding range with E, and retaliate with auto-attacks from a distance. Once you reach level 6, you can utilize R to negate Poppy's attacks while trading favorably. Prioritize items that enhance attack speed, range, and durability, and continue farming while avoiding contact with Poppy.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has high single-target damage and sticking potential against Poppy, and he can fight favorably by targeting Poppy when her shield is down. By baiting out Poppy's Q and making her miss it while going for minions, a chance to win the next trade is created. Additionally, if Kled can use his W to dodge Poppy's attacks, he can mitigate her damage while counterattacking.\n\nThe best timing to take advantage is to go all-in on Poppy at level 2. Once you confirm that Poppy's shield is not active, you can land your Q to deal damage and engage in a trade while dodging Poppy's attacks with W. It is also effective to use Poppy's E to avoid Q. This allows you to evade Poppy's CC while landing Kled's powerful attacks. Since Poppy's CoC is expected to be nerfed in the next patch, waiting for that timing can also be a good strategy.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has percentage damage and true damage against Poppy, allowing her to deal effective damage, especially against tanks. Additionally, being in Gwen's mist makes it easier to avoid Poppy's attacks, giving her high survivability in team fights. While Poppy's ability to stop dashes and leaps is powerful, Gwen has ways to evade those attacks, which can negate Poppy's strengths.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to start with a Doran's Shield and play passively. Avoid getting close to walls to dodge the second hit of Poppy's Q, and think carefully about when to use E. Avoid trades until level 6, and after reaching level 6, aim for all-ins. During this time, it's crucial to avoid Poppy's ultimate. After acquiring one item, Poppy's early tankiness decreases, increasing kill opportunities. By considering the cooldown of her ultimate while going for all-ins, Gwen can leverage her strengths and fight favorably against Poppy.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick exhibits powerful combat capabilities against juggernaut champions who lack mobility. Poppy has short burst damage and wall stun, but Yorick can utilize overwhelming numbers by summoning the Maiden, allowing him to deal sustained damage. Additionally, Yorick can create walls with his W, limiting Poppy's movement and making it harder for her to engage.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Yorick should farm while avoiding Poppy's attacks and securing healing with his Q. When Poppy engages, he can create a wall with his W to create distance and look for a counterattack opportunity. Once the mid-game begins, he should build up the Maiden before engaging, dealing damage while avoiding Poppy's skills. In the late game, he can use the Maiden and Ghost to push sides and target objectives, securing the advantage. It is crucial to engage proactively before Poppy can deal with the Maiden.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has a strong 1v1 performance against Poppy, especially with his skill set that is effective against enemies who rely on auto-attacks. Shen's W can negate auto-attacks, allowing him to deflect Poppy's attacks while using E to clear minions and trade effectively. Additionally, Shen's R can support allies from an infinite range, giving him an edge in team fights and roaming.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, use E to safely clear minions and block Poppy's approach with W. In trades, use W first, then follow up with an auto-attack and create distance with E to gain an advantage in short exchanges. After level 6, utilize R to participate in side lanes or team fights, creating situations where Poppy cannot use her blink, thus bringing 1v1 situations in your favor. It is important to avoid Poppy's crowd control while conserving shields for prolonged engagements.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf can attack while negating Poppy's W and E with his R, allowing him to engage in fights without worrying about Poppy's crowd control. Additionally, Olaf has a trait that increases his attack speed and lifesteal as his HP decreases, enabling him to maintain strong combat capabilities even when he is near death. Furthermore, Olaf's E deals true damage, providing sufficient damage output against tanks, which gives him an edge against Poppy.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, position yourself to avoid being wall-stunned by Poppy's E and engage in mini trades. After level 6, use your R to dive into Poppy, apply a slow with your Q, then chase with your E while healing with your W during the fight. It is crucial to either aim for a wall stun with your E before Poppy's R activates or to push her back with your R to create distance. As item differences emerge, Olaf can forcefully win fights when he has items like Goredrinker or Black Cleaver. Since Poppy often becomes tanky and excels in team fights, Olaf needs to create advantageous situations before that happens.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and can easily avoid Poppy's W, which negates dashes, and E, which pushes him against the wall, making it easier to evade Poppy's crowd control. Additionally, Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, allowing him to deal sustained damage and gain an advantage, especially in short trades. Furthermore, Poppy has a short range, making her at a higher risk of taking Yasuo's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize CS in the early game while forcing Poppy to use her W and E. After Poppy uses her W, you can approach with E and initiate a short trade. It is also effective to use E while positioned between minions to deal damage with Turbo Q. In team fights, using Wind Wall to block Poppy's key skills while aiming for your ultimate can create a more advantageous situation.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has range and can attack Poppy from a distance. He can farm CS with his Q while poking Poppy, making it easier to maintain lane dominance. Additionally, Urgot's R is a powerful skill that can secure kills, and by reducing Poppy's HP, he can use his R effectively.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, focus on farming CS from a distance with Q while dealing damage to Poppy, and engage in short trades with W. Save E outside of Poppy's W range, and after she uses W, use E to close the gap and deal damage with auto-attacks. Once you reach level 6, be mindful of the range of your R and aim for a kill before Poppy can use her R or before your allies can interrupt. Under the turret, it's important not to force E and to play safely while maintaining vision.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has powerful sustained damage after level 6 and has means to avoid Poppy's crowd control. Poppy excels in short trades with her durability and disruption, but Bloodmire can negate Poppy's crowd control with his W (invulnerability) and deal damage. Additionally, Bloodmire's Q healing allows him to sustain fights even when taking damage from Poppy.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use Q from a safe distance in the early game to secure CS and healing. Be wary of Poppy's E (knockback) and position yourself away from walls. Once you reach level 6, using a combo with R (E→Q healing→R) can be effective. In the mid to late game, preparing static items (such as Locket, Zhonya, and Rabadon's) will help you maximize Bloodmire's strengths in team fights.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath excels at poking from a distance and can safely farm behind minions while dealing damage to Poppy with his E. Additionally, Cho'Gath can save his Q to interrupt Poppy's charge, allowing him to effectively counterattack when she tries to engage. Furthermore, Cho'Gath has a silence (W) that can disable Poppy's abilities, preventing her from attacking.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it's important to poke Poppy from a distance with E and save Q to stop her charge. Avoid getting close to positions where Poppy can use walls, and always maintain distance while farming. It can also be effective to look for moments when Poppy misses her Q to engage in a short trade with an E→AA→W combo. In team fights, it's advisable to save R and attack when Poppy is isolated to secure kills.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has a 51% win rate against Poppy, and his sustained combat power and healing are particularly strong after level 6. While Poppy excels at preventing dashes and leaps, Aatrox can leverage his sustained damage and healing to gain the upper hand in prolonged fights. Additionally, by avoiding Poppy's CC skills, Aatrox can continue to attack more easily.\n\nTo take advantage, first utilize Aatrox's R (World Ender) after level 6 and focus on sustained combat. It is important to position and time your dodges appropriately to avoid Poppy's E (Heroic Charge) and Q (Hammer Shock) stuns. Furthermore, since Poppy has low mobility, coordinating ganks with the jungler can be effective. This creates a favorable situation against Poppy and allows you to advance the fight in your favor.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage against Poppy, especially strong in short trades. While Poppy excels at preventing dashes and leaps, Camille has a long-range blink, making it easier to avoid Poppy's CC and utilize her mobility to attack. Additionally, Poppy's skill range is short, allowing Camille to trade while maintaining distance.\n\nTo take advantage, first, always check Poppy's passive and wait until you can secure CS. It's important to dodge Poppy's Q, as its animation is easy to read. During trades, use Camille's Q and W to counterattack, and avoid trading when Poppy's passive is active. Stay away from walls and try to all-in after Poppy uses her W. Also, it's crucial to save E for Poppy's R and use it at the right moment for re-engagement. Engaging in many short trades and having Second Wind or Refill to ensure sustain is also key.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite is primarily a tank that relies on physical damage and has strong engage capabilities, especially against AD champions. Poppy excels at preventing dashes and leaps, but Malphite can mitigate Poppy's attacks by reducing her attack speed with his E. Additionally, Malphite's R can effectively utilize the knock-up effect by forcing Poppy to use her W first, allowing him to gain an advantage in team fights and one-on-one situations.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to harass with Q between levels 1 and 3 to create a minion advantage. Use E while avoiding walls, and position yourself to prevent being wall-stunned by Poppy's E. After level 6, you can rush in with R after forcing Poppy to use her W first, allowing you to avoid her counterattack. Regarding the build, if facing AD, it is advisable to stack physical defense, and choosing an AP build can also allow for instant burst damage. This way, you can create a favorable situation against Poppy.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high sustained damage and self-healing capabilities, especially with the powerful healing from his Q. Additionally, he can utilize the mobility from his E to dodge Poppy's skills and close the distance. While Poppy's dash disruption and wall stun are strong, Tremendous can become invulnerable for 5 seconds with his R, allowing him to negate Poppy's CC while continuing to attack.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to prioritize farming in the early lane phase without forcing aggression, building up anger. After Poppy uses her E or W, you can engage with your E, deal short bursts of damage, and heal with your Q for sustained damage output. Also, be mindful of your positioning to avoid getting cornered by Poppy, and use your R as insurance during skirmishes to maintain an advantage in the matchup against Poppy. In team fights, you can fight more effectively by avoiding Poppy's CC and attacking from the side."

    "beats": {
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has ranged attacks and a passive that makes it easy to aim for stuns. Kennen can harass with his Q and build up marks with his W, applying sustained pressure on Yasuo. Additionally, Kennen's R has high crowd control in team fights, making it difficult for Yasuo to approach. Furthermore, Yasuo is disadvantaged against tank champions with crowd control, and he becomes significantly weaker when hit by Kennen's stuns and damage in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Use Wind Wall to block Kennen's Q and reduce harassment.\n2. Utilize minions to approach with E while avoiding Kennen's attacks during trades.\n3. Time your full combo (E→Q→Q3→R) for when Kennen's skills are on cooldown.\n4. Manage the lane properly to prevent Kennen from hiding behind minions.\n5. Save your shield (Wind's Refuge) to prepare for Kennen's R or stuns.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Yasuo can increase his chances of gaining an advantage over Kennen.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has a high ability to aim for stuns in close combat, and especially in team fights, his ultimate provides powerful area damage and crowd control. Quinn has low durability, and if she takes Kennen's skills, her HP can be quickly depleted. Additionally, Kennen initiates trades with his Q and W, so even though Quinn has a long range, it becomes difficult to retaliate if he gets close. Furthermore, the only means of escape against Kennen's ultimate is her E, but if the timing is off, there is a risk of getting caught.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to take Exhaust to reduce Kennen's damage, especially to prevent his all-out attacks after level 6. Establishing lane dominance early and preventing Kennen from pushing is crucial. During trades, when Kennen approaches, make sure to retaliate with Q and maintain distance. Additionally, choosing Edge of Night in item selection allows for a more favorable fight in 1v1 situations, and prioritizing roaming can effectively apply pressure across the map.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has ranged attacks and excels at dealing chip damage before Darius can close the gap. In order to aim for a stun with Kennen's passive, Darius needs to get close, but Kennen can continue to attack while maintaining that distance. Additionally, Kennen has high mobility and can avoid Darius's E snare, making it difficult for Darius to engage in favorable long trades. Furthermore, Darius has low durability and is vulnerable to Kennen's area damage in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to pay attention to minions in the early game and maneuver to avoid Kennen's attacks. Conserving E and looking for a counterattack when Kennen approaches can be effective. Also, after level 6, using R to prevent Kennen from stacking his passive and launching a sudden attack when he gets close is necessary. Additionally, utilizing jungle intervention to apply pressure on Kennen can also be effective.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Kennen's long-range attacks and instant stun ability. Kennen excels at poking from a distance with his Q and can easily close the gap with his E. Additionally, his R after level 6 has a high impact in team fights, and since Singed needs to keep approaching, he is very vulnerable to Kennen's skills. Furthermore, while Singed is durable, getting hit by Kennen's stun can quickly put him in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, in the early game, it is important to avoid Kennen's Q while farming CS and not to overextend. Between levels 3 and 5, look for opportunities to pull Kennen in with your E, and only engage after checking the cooldowns of Kennen's E and W. Also, after level 6, it is crucial to keep your distance when you see Kennen's R signal. In team fights, Singed can apply pressure by using split pushing and proxy farming, maneuvering to avoid Kennen's R, which can help turn the tide of the battle in his favor.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen's high harassment ability and crowd control (CC) skills make it very difficult for Jax to approach. Kennen can attack from a distance using his Q and W, stacking up to aim for a stun, which puts Jax at a disadvantage in trades. Additionally, while Kennen is strong against champions with low durability, Jax excels in close combat, making it hard for him to avoid Kennen's attacks and more susceptible to damage. Furthermore, Jax has low durability in the early game and is highly dependent on items, making it difficult to farm against Kennen early on.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to choose Second Wind or Doran's Shield and endure until level 9. By baiting Kennen's Q and having it hit the minion wave, you can reduce damage taken. Additionally, rushing Mercury's Treads as your first item will improve your movement speed and resistance, making it easier to dodge Kennen's attacks. Considering asking for help from the jungler and using biscuits to save mana while engaging in short trades can also be effective. After acquiring Sheen and Trinity Force, you will be able to counter Kennen, so it is crucial to continue farming without rushing.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has ranged attacks and can deal high damage quickly, making it difficult for Sett to zone and poke. By landing Kennen's skills, he can stack up and aim for a stun, making it hard for Sett to approach. Additionally, Sett has limited means of closing the gap and finds it difficult to avoid Kennen's ultimate, making him less effective in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following strategies can be considered:\n1. Purchase a **Doran's Shield** to prepare for Kennen's ranged attacks.\n2. Play passively until level 6 and avoid isolation by waiting for ganks.\n3. Buy Stridebreaker early to gain an advantage in 1v1 duels.\n4. Block experience at level 1 and trade to suppress Kennen's harassment.\n5. Freeze the lane after level 3 to aim for Flash or Ignite.\n6. Look for the right timing to counterattack after Kennen uses his ultimate.\n7. Rush to buy **Mercury's Treads** to reduce the duration of stuns.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, Sett can mitigate his disadvantage in the matchup against Kennen and fight more favorably.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Kennen's instant AoE stun (passive + R) and high damage output in close combat. Kennen can quickly close the gap with E, easily mark Teemo with his skills, and especially after level 6, he can apply pressure in team fights and 1v1s using R. Additionally, Teemo has low burst damage in team fights and is vulnerable to Kennen's sustained damage. Furthermore, Teemo's blind effect does not affect Kennen's skills, making it difficult for Teemo to gain an advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to harass with Q while maintaining distance and to predict Kennen's approach with E by placing mushrooms. This allows you to deal damage while securing vision as Kennen approaches. Also, after level 6, it is crucial to be cautious of Kennen's R and to maintain a safe distance without forcing an engagement. In terms of item selection, focusing on health and mana regeneration and choosing items that allow for sustained damage can help you trade favorably against Kennen.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Kennen's long-range poke and area stun abilities. Kennen can safely harass using his skills, making it difficult for Braum to approach. In particular, by using Kennen's E to maintain distance while landing skills, Braum is likely to miss his opportunity to engage. Additionally, Kennen's R has high crowd control in team fights, and if Braum gets stunned when he tries to close the gap, he can quickly find himself in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to focus on safely landing skills from behind minions and drawing out Kennen's abilities. After forcing Kennen to use his E or W, Braum can approach from behind the minions and aim for a short trade with Q → AA → W. Furthermore, after level 6, while being mindful of Kennen's R, Braum can time his approach to leverage his strengths. Strengthening coordination with the allied jungler and looking for ganks can also effectively apply pressure on Kennen.",
      "ナー": "Naut is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has high ability power and excellent skill mobility, making him proficient in harassment and CS in the lane. In particular, Kennen's passive makes it easy to aim for stuns, and his ability to deal damage in close combat is high, making Naut especially weak to all-ins when in mini form. Additionally, Kennen's R (Lightning Rush) deals damage over a wide area, posing a threat to Naut in team fights. Furthermore, managing Naut's transformation is difficult, and especially in mini form, his base stats are low, making him susceptible to Kennen's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to always pay attention to positioning during the laning phase and avoid Kennen's skills. Effectively timing Naut's E (Jump) to dodge Kennen's W (Stun) is beneficial. It is also important to be aware of the timing of transformations and to leverage the powerful CC in Mega Naut form to counter Kennen. In terms of item builds, prioritizing items that increase durability is essential to withstand Kennen's damage. In team fights, aim to utilize Naut's large form attacks and stun enemies before taking Kennen's R.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has high magic power and excellent skill motion, making him good at harassment and CS in the lane. In particular, after using Kennen's E, he can aim for a stun, making trades in close combat difficult. Additionally, Kennen has strong self-defense and possesses an ultimate that deals area damage in team fights, creating situations where it is hard for Renekton to approach. Furthermore, Kennen is favored against champions with low durability and can leverage his stun to fight advantageously against champions like Renekton, who excel in close combat, putting Renekton in a disadvantageous position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Renekton to attack after forcing Kennen to use his E. This allows him to initiate trades while avoiding Kennen's stun. Additionally, Renekton can prioritize CS and concede priority until level 3 to avoid unnecessary trades. Moreover, playing aggressively and trying to induce mistakes from Kennen can create opportunities to gain a lead. Finally, choosing to take TP and considering roaming to other lanes can allow Renekton to have an impact on the overall game.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has strong harassment abilities from the early game and can aim for stuns in a short time, making it difficult for Kail to approach. In particular, Kail is very weak in the early game and remains at a disadvantage against other champions until reaching level 6. Kennen can repeatedly engage in short trades using his W and chip away at Kail's health with auto-attacks, making it hard for Kail to secure CS. Additionally, Kennen's CC skills make it difficult for Kail to escape and vulnerable to ambushes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on CS without forcing trades in the early game. Storing E under the minions and prioritizing healing and potions to maintain health is crucial. After level 6, Kail can use R to protect allies, so it is important to deal DPS from a safe position during team fights. Also, utilizing bushes to heal and conserving Flash can help prepare against ambushes.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has powerful AoE attacks from a distance, giving him overwhelming control, especially in team fights. Fiora excels in close combat, but when hit by Kennen's E or R, she becomes vulnerable to attacks and loses her chance to counterattack due to being stunned. Additionally, Fiora is weak against crowd control, and to avoid Kennen's stun, she needs to use her W properly, but it's difficult to predict the timing of Kennen's skills. Furthermore, Kennen is good at poking in lane, and since Fiora lacks sustain, she can find herself in a tough situation when harassed.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, at the start of the lane, it's important to save W behind the minions and prepare to stop Kennen's E or R. In trades, when Kennen approaches with E, aim for Vitals with a Q→AA→E combo and try to disengage quickly. It's also crucial to use minions to get closer before taking Kennen's poke. After level 6, pay attention to Kennen's R and look for a chance to take him down with a short all-in after he uses it. Finally, if winning, always side push to create a tower advantage, which is an effective strategy to avoid team fights.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen has instant mobility and can escape using his skills. Kennen can deal widespread damage with his ultimate and aim for stuns, making it difficult for Aatrox to approach. Additionally, Kennen is strong against champions with low durability, while Aatrox has high durability and excels in close combat, creating a favorable matchup for Kennen. Furthermore, Aatrox's skills have long animations, making it hard to hit the highly mobile Kennen.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Wave Management**: It is important to manage the minion wave near your tower to avoid taking damage from Kennen's attacks, which will make it harder for him to harass you.\n\n2. **Utilizing Teleport**: Using Teleport to influence other lanes or adjust your shopping timing can help you avoid one-on-one situations with Kennen.\n\n3. **Item Build**: Purchasing durability-boosting items early (e.g., Guardian Angel or Spirit Visage) can effectively reduce Kennen's damage.\n\n4. **Team Coordination**: Coordinating with the jungler and other lanes to isolate Kennen can create opportunities to leverage Aatrox's strengths.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can mitigate the disadvantage against Kennen and progress the game in your favor."

    "loses": {
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high sustain capabilities and fights by consuming his HP. While Kennen's attacks are strong for early poke, Mundo's self-healing ability is high, allowing him to offset Kennen's damage by dragging the fight into the long term. Additionally, Mundo has a passive that negates hard CC, making him less susceptible to Kennen's stun and allowing him to engage favorably in close combat.\n\nTo take advantage, first focus on farming with Q in the early game while positioning to avoid Kennen's Q. In the mid-lane phase, prioritize building magic resistance and initiate an all-in after confirming Kennen's E and R. After Kennen uses his main skills, heal with R and drag the fight into the long term to leverage your sustain for an advantage. In team fights, maintain the frontline while staying out of the range of Kennen's R, choosing the right moment to engage, which maximizes Mundo's strengths.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has the ability to attack from a distance, and his skill range is long, making it easier to harass while avoiding Kennen's attacks. Additionally, by using Gangplank's W skill, he can cleanse Kennen's CC while healing, which increases his survivability in the lane. Furthermore, Kennen cannot fully utilize his potential without getting close, so by keeping his distance, Gangplank can avoid Kennen's stun.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use Fleet Footwork for quick trades and reduce Kennen's auto-attacks. By staying near minions, you can prevent Kennen from using his Q (Thundering Shuriken) and create situations where he has to attack minions to charge his passive. After level 6, even if you take damage from Kennen's attacks, you can mitigate it by using W (Remove Scurvy), allowing you to engage more aggressively. Since using W after the first stun provides less healing, it is crucial to time your W before receiving the second stun. This way, you can maneuver favorably against Kennen and increase your chances of victory.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has high poke ability from a distance, allowing him to deal damage to Kennen with his Q (Shock Blast) while maintaining distance. Additionally, by using his E (Gate), he can attack while moving, making it easier to prevent Kennen from closing the gap. Furthermore, Jayce can transform into his hammer form for melee attacks, but he excels at whittling down Kennen primarily from range.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to push the minions early in the lane with Q+E, switch to hammer form after observing Kennen's E, and attack after he has used it. By not getting too close to the minions and dodging Kennen's Q sideways, you can continue harassing without taking damage. After level 6, while being cautious of Kennen's R, you can maintain an advantageous position by securing vision and continuing to poke from long range in team fights.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is favored.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, as his damage scales infinitely by stacking his Q. While Kennen is strong in the early game, once Nasus grows, he becomes very durable and can survive better in team fights. Additionally, Nasus's W slow and attack speed reduction limit Kennen's attacks, allowing Nasus to maintain an advantage in close combat.\n\nTo gain an advantage, in the early game, safely last-hit with Q from the back and prioritize stacking. Use potions or Doran’s Shield to avoid Kennen's harassment and position yourself to take less damage. When Kennen approaches with his E, slow him down with W and then attack with Q. After reaching level 6, you can take advantage of a short window after using your R to launch a strong attack against Kennen. In team fights, it is important to step forward as a tank and support your team by utilizing Nasus's durability.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high durability and can demonstrate powerful engage capabilities, especially against AD champions. Kennen cannot unleash his full potential without getting close, and due to his low durability, he can be quickly neutralized by Malphite's R knock-up. Additionally, Kennen's skills primarily deal magic damage, while Malphite relies on physical defense, making it easier for him to shrug off Kennen's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be aware of Kennen's Q and W range between levels 1 and 5 and to position yourself behind minions. Place minions in front and poke with E to chip away at his health. After level 6, before Kennen has his E and R ready, you can engage from the side with your R, and if your teammates have CC, you can immediately follow up with R → W → Q to attack. In team fights, it is crucial for Malphite to play the role of shutting down Kennen's R, being mindful of vision and positioning to prevent Kennen from using his R first.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration and an ultimate that makes him invincible for 5 seconds, making him very strong in one-on-one situations and tower dives. Kennen has poke and crowd control from a distance, but Tremendous has high damage in close combat and can attack while dodging Kennen's skills. Additionally, by using his ultimate before getting hit by Kennen's crowd control, he can create opportunities for a comeback.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the lane, conserve Q behind the minions while prioritizing CS and avoiding Kennen's Q. It is important to charge in after Kennen uses his E or Flash, aiming for an instant kill if jungle support is available. In team fights, assess the enemy's ultimate and crowd control before acting, and apply pressure through split pushing. This way, he can suppress Kennen's strength in team fights while leveraging his own advantages.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick possesses high durability and attack power through his pets, allowing him to approach and attack while taking Kennen's ranged attacks. In particular, Kennen cannot fully utilize his abilities without getting close, so Yorick can gain an advantage over Kennen by closing the distance and initiating attacks. Additionally, Yorick's crowd control using his wall helps to restrict Kennen's movements.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early lane phase, manage the minions and position yourself to avoid Kennen's Q. Once you reach level 6, summon the Maiden with W to apply pressure and zone Kennen. In team fights, while protecting the Maiden, charge at squishy AP carries like Kennen to deal damage and create advantageous situations. It is also important to push the side lanes to make it difficult for Kennen to participate in team fights.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon is a very powerful champion in early short trades, especially excelling at all-ins from level 2. Utilizing Pantheon's W for the stun, he can deal high damage with auto-attacks and Q. Additionally, Pantheon can use his E to mitigate damage while attacking, making it difficult for Kennen to hit him. Furthermore, Pantheon has a global R, which gives him significant influence over other lanes, making it easier to extend his early advantage to them.\n\nTo take advantage, first aim for level 2, charge at Kennen with W, and deal damage with auto-attacks and Q after stunning him. When Kennen tries to create distance, it's important to use E to move forward and continue attacking while suppressing the opponent's counterattack. Also, using side wards to set up ambushes can effectively create unfavorable situations for Kennen. By gaining an early advantage, you can push the game in your favor before Kennen can grow strong.",
      "オーロラ": "Aurora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and can fight while avoiding Kennen's attacks. Kennen needs to land his skills to aim for a stun, but Aurora can use her W to enter stealth and evade Kennen's attacks. Additionally, Aurora's passive healing effect is very powerful in prolonged fights, allowing her to withstand Kennen's poke.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to mark the minions and Kennen with Q at the beginning of the lane, then retreat with E to avoid counterattacks. Once Kennen uses his E, you can disengage with Q and aim for penetration damage. After level 6, it's effective to use your R from a position where you won't get caught by Kennen's R, controlling the area and coordinating with your teammates to trap Kennen. Also, using W to dodge Kennen's skills and timing your attacks when you have 3 stacks of passive will be beneficial.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is strong in close combat and can safely farm minions with her Q while taking harassment from Kennen's range. Additionally, Irelia's W provides damage reduction, which is very effective when taking Kennen's skills. Furthermore, Irelia can reliably stack her E, making it easier to aim for a stun on Kennen. After level 6, Irelia can utilize her R to deal damage in team fights while avoiding Kennen's area stun.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, be cautious of Kennen's range and prioritize growth by safely CSing from behind minions with Q instead of forcing a front engagement. After level 3, initiate short trades with Q→W, dealing damage by weaving in auto-attacks before fully taking Kennen's W or Q. Use E in situations where you can reliably stack it, and after level 6, aim for tanking in side lanes or flashing in during team fights, while being mindful of Kennen's area stun and attacking from outside the range of R. Using wards to secure vision and understanding the opponent's movements can create more advantageous situations.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has high durability and is a champion strong in close combat, making it easier to avoid Kennen's skills that aim to stun. Kennen cannot perform well without getting close, and due to his low durability, he can take significant damage from Urgot's attacks. Additionally, Urgot's percentage damage is very effective against low-durability champions like Kennen.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be cautious of Kennen's ranged attacks at the start of the lane and not to engage recklessly. Around level 3, after Kennen has used his skills, you can approach with E and deal damage with W and Q. Attacking when Kennen's E is unavailable or during the cooldown of his ultimate can give you the upper hand. It is also effective to hide behind minions to avoid Kennen's attacks while maintaining distance to engage. In the late game, standing at the front during team fights and using R to reliably eliminate enemies is a key point to leverage Urgot's strengths.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire can deal sustained damage to the low-durability Kennen, especially by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W to avoid Kennen's crowd control. Additionally, Bloodmire's Q provides sustain, making it easier to manage health in lane and endure Kennen's harassment. Furthermore, after level 6, Bloodmire can use his R to deal sustained damage in team fights, countering Kennen's strengths in those situations.\n\nTo take advantage, first focus on farming while avoiding Kennen's Q in the early game, hitting minions with Q to heal. It's important not to stack E too much and to unleash damage at the right moment. When Kennen approaches, use W to avoid the stun and look for a chance to counterattack. After level 6, utilize R to target MP in team fights, dealing sustained damage while avoiding Kennen's crowd control, allowing you to progress the game in your favor.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high durability and can counter Kennen using his Q knock-up and W silence. Kennen cannot fully utilize his abilities without getting close, so by using silence, Cho'Gath can negate Kennen's skills and initiate attacks. Additionally, Cho'Gath has strong HP regeneration and sustainability, making him excellent at maintaining his presence in lane.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to focus on magic resistance in the early game and not to overextend. Manage the minions without pushing too hard while avoiding Kennen's Q. When Kennen uses his E or R, you can land your Q (Rupture) and then get close to apply W silence, effectively shutting down Kennen's attacks. In the mid-game and beyond, you can engage in team fights by moving forward with your R to interrupt, and based on the position of Kennen's R, either use Q to engage or silence to stop him, allowing your team to gain an advantage in team fights.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, allowing him to deal damage while avoiding Kennen's stun during short trades. In particular, by using Gragas's E, he can avoid Kennen's mark and gain an advantage in close combat. Additionally, using Gragas's R can prevent Kennen's all-in and improve positioning in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, close the distance with Q, and while avoiding Kennen's mark with E, retaliate with a short combo (Q→E→W). When Kennen aims for a stun, position yourself to avoid stepping on barrels and use Gragas's R to limit Kennen's movement. After level 6, it is important to use R to pull Kennen closer or push him away, gaining an advantage in prolonged fights and harassment. In team fights, breaking the enemy formation with Gragas's R and creating opportunities to utilize Kennen's ultimate leads to victory.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage and mobility, making her strong in short trades in close combat. Kennen has low durability and cannot perform well without getting close, making him susceptible to Camille's attacks. Additionally, Camille's passive provides a shield, allowing her to withstand Kennen's harassment more easily. Furthermore, Camille has a long-range blink, which makes it easier to avoid Kennen's crowd control and allows her to initiate attacks against him.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to play behind minions or near walls to avoid Kennen's skills. Before level 6, if you don't hit your Q, you won't get stunned, so you should trade while waiting for the opponent to make a mistake. You can approach with E, poke with W, and attack when your passive is activated to fight favorably against Kennen. Also, by purchasing magic resistance items early and building Mercury's Treads or Maokai's, you can reduce Kennen's damage while also being effective in team fights. Once you have three items (Trinity Force, Ravenous Hydra, and Sterak's), your chances of winning in a 1v1 increase significantly.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen possesses tank characteristics and is strong in close combat. Kennen is a mage who fights using ranged attacks and stuns, but Shen can use his E's taunt to disable Kennen's skills and approach to deal damage with auto-attacks and Q. Additionally, Shen's global assistance ability with his R is extremely powerful in team fights and supporting allies.\n\nTo take advantage, first prioritize CS without overextending between levels 1 and 3, enduring Kennen's Q with healing and a Doran's Shield. It is important to approach the moment Kennen uses his E or other key skills, catch him with a taunt, and initiate a short skirmish with auto-attacks and Q. Also, manage the wave to reduce poke by letting it push towards your side, and aim for a full combo when the jungler arrives. After level 6, use your R on the ally side to apply pressure and actively engage in 1v1s against your opponent to secure the advantage.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and excels at engaging and crowd control in team fights as a tank. Kennen cannot fully utilize his abilities without getting close, and he needs to land his skills to aim for a stun, but Sion can absorb those attacks, allowing him to withstand Kennen's harassment. Additionally, Sion's crowd control skills are powerful, especially his R ability, which charges and knocks up, making it effective against Kennen.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, avoid unnecessary trades and farm behind minions while being careful not to take poke from Kennen's Q and E. Focus on wave management and freeze the wave near the tower to lure Kennen into roaming or jungle intervention. After level 6, use R to engage, utilizing Flash and W shield to endure while avoiding Kennen's stun. In team fights, serve as the frontline tank, positioning carefully while being wary of Kennen's instant stun, and use R at the start to peel or disrupt the enemy carry, allowing the game to progress in your favor.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability and excels in close combat as a tank, making him less susceptible to Kennen's ranged attacks and harassment. Ornn's skills have crowd control (CC), and by utilizing the wall stun from his E, he can easily restrict Kennen's movements. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, allowing him to maintain his lane effectively and providing high sustain. This makes it easier for him to endure Kennen's harassment and maintain lane dominance.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it's important to be aware of Kennen's Q poke while minimizing damage by hiding behind minions. Utilizing W and healing is crucial, and avoiding risky trades is important. Around level 6, while saving Ornn's R for team fights, aim for a 1v1 on the side while being cautious of Kennen's ultimate. If the wall stun from E lands, it creates an opportunity to fight favorably against Kennen. In the mid to late game, standing in the front line, using R to crush the enemy's core, and absorbing Kennen's engage to protect allies allows Ornn to shine in team fights.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser's R (Ultimate) can negate Kennen's engage. Kennen needs to get close to land his stun, but by using his R, Mordekaiser can trap Kennen in the realm of death, creating a 1v1 situation. This significantly reduces Kennen's impact in team fights. Additionally, Mordekaiser has a shield and can deal sustained damage, making him resistant to Kennen's harassment.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on trading in the lane first, using Q (Death's Grasp) and E (Death's Call) to deal damage to Kennen while increasing your movement speed with your passive. You can gain the upper hand by counterattacking after Kennen uses his skills. After level 6, aim to isolate Kennen with your R and win the duel. By building your items, you can further establish an advantage over Kennen."

    "beats": {
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has strong burst damage from the early game, giving her an advantage, especially in short trades. Trades using Camille's W and E do not allow Nasus to retaliate with his slow from W, reducing his opportunities to stack with Q. Additionally, Camille has high mobility and can apply pressure before Nasus can scale, making Nasus very weak against early zoning and tower dives.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize safety in the early game and avoid trades with Camille. Save Q for last-hitting minions and position yourself to avoid Camille's attacks. After level 6, you can use W to stop Camille's auto-attacks and Q, allowing you to turn the fight into a long-term battle where you can gain an advantage. Also, prioritize health and defensive items in your item choices to effectively reduce Camille's damage.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high mobility and can use walls to gain advantageous positions. In close combat using Camille's E, she can often avoid Garen's Q silence effect, diminishing his advantage in short trades. Additionally, Camille is strong in prolonged fights, as she can use shields to withstand Garen's sustained damage, making long trades unfavorable for him. Furthermore, Camille's R creates a separation effect that makes it difficult for Garen to fulfill his role in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on short trades in the early lane phase and maintain distance before Camille's E lands. Freezing the minion wave to avoid Camille's attacks while dealing damage with the Q→E combo and purchasing armor or a Black Cleaver early to increase durability is effective. Also, after level 6, coordinating with the ally jungler to bait Camille's R can be a good strategy to time an attack.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has a high solo kill potential with her R after level 6, and her E, which utilizes walls for attacks, is particularly powerful. While Riven excels in short trades, Camille's W can negate Riven's combos due to the shield it provides. Additionally, Camille has a passive shield that can reduce Riven's burst damage. Furthermore, Camille's high mobility makes it difficult for Riven to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, it is important to check Camille's W cooldown and then go for an all-in combo afterward. Also, aiming for a quick resolution before reaching level 6 while being cautious of Camille's R and maintaining vision is crucial. In terms of items, prioritizing armor penetration and choosing durability-boosting items (e.g., Black Cleaver or Sterak's) can help Riven trade more favorably against Camille.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille can use her E (wall jump → stun) to restrict Kled's movements and isolate him with her R (isolation). Camille's burst damage is high and can potentially exceed Kled's shield and healing, especially in short skirmishes. Additionally, Camille has high mobility and has ways to escape when Kled tries to chase her. Furthermore, Camille's strength against champions that can negate auto-attacks is troublesome for Kled.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to be cautious with minion farming in the early lane phase and to play safely to avoid losing Skarl. Attacking after seeing Camille's E can reduce the risk of counterattacks. Also, constantly checking the minimap and paying attention to Camille's roaming is crucial for placing wards on the sides and securing vision. During all-ins, focusing on dealing damage quickly and positioning to avoid forcing Camille to use her R can be effective. If health is low, it is better not to force fights and instead coordinate with the jungle or allies to reset the situation, which will increase Kled's chances of survival.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille is strong in sustained 1v1 fights, especially after level 6, where she excels in battles outside of towers thanks to her R. Camille can interrupt Pantheon's engage with her E, making Pantheon's short trades less effective. Additionally, Camille has a shield from her passive, which mitigates Pantheon's burst damage. Furthermore, Camille has high mobility, making it easier for her to dodge Pantheon's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to push the minions early to force Camille to use her E and create opportunities for trades. After level 6, it is necessary to be wary of Camille's R roams, secure vision, and coordinate with teammates. As for items, purchasing armor early can help reduce Camille's damage, allowing for a sustained fight.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high mobility and burst damage, and can overwhelm Yorick with her instant firepower from her ultimate after level 6. Camille can jump over walls with her E and attack while reducing damage with her W shield, making it easy to neutralize Yorick's wall and Mist Walkers. Additionally, since Yorick relies on his pets, his combat ability significantly decreases when Maiden is absent or when he cannot create favorable conditions against Camille.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to avoid Camille's attacks while marking her with E to trade, and to sustain fights using Q for healing. Also, using W to interrupt Camille's E and limit her movement can help turn fights in your favor. Furthermore, being aware of Camille's weakness to ganks, it is effective to avoid pushing the lane too much and to use TP at the right time to call for support.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Camille's high burst damage and mobility. Camille can use her E (Hookshot) to jump to walls, allowing her to gain an advantage in close trades. Additionally, Camille's passive shield and strength in short trades may surpass Malphite's durability. Furthermore, Malphite relies on his hard CC (R - Meteor), making it difficult to counter Camille's mobility, and he becomes disadvantaged when Camille utilizes wall jumps in fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points should be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to avoid pushing minions safely and not to force trades, so as not to provoke Camille's E. By positioning away from walls, you can negate Camille's wall jumps and look for opportunities to engage in team fights when you can use your R. Additionally, prioritizing armor and HP in your build to increase durability is crucial for contributing to team fights. After level 6, roaming and utilizing your R in team fights can provide more opportunities to counter Camille.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage and mobility, and her engage with E and R is particularly powerful. Camille's E allows her to close the gap using walls, enabling her to attack while avoiding Gragas's skills. Additionally, Camille's R isolates enemies, reducing Gragas's opportunities to counterattack. Furthermore, Camille has high resistance to Gragas's skills, making it difficult for Gragas to effectively utilize his CC and AoE damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use minions to bait Camille's E in the early game and harass her from a distance with Q. Look for opportunities to counterattack when Camille misses her E, and use the stun from E to either engage or escape effectively. After level 6, saving R to disrupt Camille's engage with a knockback can help prevent her attacks. In team fights, it is also important to choose tankier items to increase durability while utilizing AoE damage effectively.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has strong 1v1 capabilities from the early game, and especially before Kail reaches level 6, she is very weak, making it easy for Camille to create advantageous situations. Camille's approach with her E and burst damage from her R are difficult for Kail to handle when she is still underdeveloped, and particularly when Kail's auto-attacks are negated, she cannot deal damage and ends up at a disadvantage in trades. Additionally, Kail lacks hard CC, so her means to suppress Camille's mobility are limited.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid careless 1v1s in the early game and prioritize CS under the tower. By watching for Camille's E landings and R charges, you can create slightly more favorable situations by requesting pokes or ganks. Also, using W for healing or escape and purchasing Stopwatch or Zhonya early can help deflect Camille's attacks. After level 6, it is effective to save R and become invulnerable when Camille engages, aiming for a chance to counterattack.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high mobility and burst damage, allowing her to outmaneuver Ornn, especially in one-on-one situations. In close combat after using her E, Ornn is vulnerable to Camille's isolated attacks from her R, making it difficult for Ornn, who needs to prepare to apply crowd control, to deal with Camille's mobility. Additionally, Camille can ignore the shield from Ornn's W and deal high damage, making trades unfavorable for him.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use the positioning of walls and minions to avoid Camille's skills during the laning phase. Particularly, counterattacking right after Camille uses her E or when she is under the tower can help turn trades in Ornn's favor. Furthermore, purchasing Bramble Vest or armor items early can help reduce Camille's sustain, making trades more favorable. In team fights, it is crucial to coordinate with allies to utilize Ornn's R and block Camille's escape routes.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tryndamere is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Camille's high burst damage and crowd control (CC) abilities. Camille excels at hooking with her E and locking down in 1v1 situations with her R, especially after Tryndamere has used his ultimate. Additionally, Camille can poke with her Q from the early game, allowing her to deal damage before Tryndamere can heal, making him more vulnerable in early trades. Furthermore, since Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, he takes significant damage when affected by Camille's stun.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on farming (CS) and safely maintain the lane without forcing trades in the early game. After using Camille's E, it is advisable to save your ultimate until level 6 and look for an opportunity to engage aggressively. Buying a Bramble Vest early can also be effective in reducing Camille's healing. This increases the chances of coming out ahead in trades against Camille.",
      "ナー": "Gnar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has powerful solo kill potential, especially with her R and E used for isolated kills after level 6, which is a significant threat. In mini form, Gnar has low base stats and is weak in all-ins, making it difficult to counter Camille's Q's double hit and wall stick with her E. Additionally, Gnar must manage the timing of becoming Mega Gnar effectively against Camille's mobility and burst damage, making close combat unfavorable due to the difficulty in managing his transformation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to keep the following points in mind:\n1. In the early laning phase, use Q in mini form to poke Camille and maintain distance.\n2. Be cautious of Camille's E and look for a counterattack after she uses it, positioning yourself to avoid being stuck against the wall.\n3. After level 6, stay near allies and be wary of Camille's R, using W or E to stop her engage when you become Mega Gnar.\n4. In terms of item selection, prioritize purchasing armor items (like Ninja Tabi or Frozen items) and anti-healing items (like Bramble Vest) early to reduce Camille's damage.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Camille's high burst damage and ability to isolate targets. Camille excels at closing the gap with her E and gaining an advantage in short trades. Additionally, Camille can isolate Anbessa with her R, allowing her to deal significant damage instantly, making Anbessa unfavorable in one-on-one fights against Camille. Furthermore, Camille is strong against champions that can negate auto-attacks, but Anbessa lacks such traits, making her more susceptible to Camille's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to position oneself to avoid Camille's E while using Q and E to manage waves and build up passive. Additionally, using W to absorb damage and deflect Camille's attacks can be effective. Moreover, being cautious of Camille's R and requesting jungle support can create opportunities to isolate Camille. In team fights, targeting the backline with R can help reduce Camille's impact.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage and mobility, making her particularly strong against Yasuo in one-on-one situations. Camille excels at trading after using her E (Hookshot), and Yasuo needs to avoid prolonged fights during that time. Additionally, Camille's R (Hextech Ultimatum) can isolate Yasuo, making it difficult for him to respond, which puts him at a disadvantage in one-on-one situations. Furthermore, Yasuo is weak against crowd control, and being hit by Camille's stun can quickly lead to a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use minions to safely approach with E in the early stages of laning and poke with Q. Yasuo can increase his chances of attacking by engaging after Camille has used her E or forced her to use Flash. Also, saving W (Wind Wall) to block Camille's ranged abilities and using it at the right moment can negate her attacks. After level 6, it is crucial to position yourself to avoid Camille's R and to seek support from allies to avoid one-on-one situations.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage, making her particularly strong in one-on-one trades. Camille's mobility with her E and the shield from her W make it easy to negate Set's attacks, making it difficult for Set to close the gap. Additionally, Camille's R counters Set's W, making it hard for Set to play favorably. Furthermore, Camille can deal more single-target damage against Set, who lacks AoE damage, allowing her to maintain an advantage in extended fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid one-on-one trades and focus on team fights. Landing R while Camille is using her E can increase your chances of winning. Additionally, saving E for a stun and aiming to stun before taking damage from Camille's attacks can be effective. In terms of item builds, choosing bruiser items and building Stridebreaker or Black Cleaver can enhance your ability to counter Camille. Moreover, it is crucial to overwhelm Camille before level 6 to secure kills and a CS lead.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high single-target damage and mobility, and especially after level 6, she can isolate Singed with her ultimate to aim for a quick kill. Camille's approach using her E is also very effective, and Singed tends to struggle against burst damage, often losing in isolated 1v1 situations. While Singed excels at sustained damage, he often cannot counter Camille's burst damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to confront her head-on in the early game, but instead to proxy farm and push the lane to gain experience and CS. Additionally, using E to throw enemies towards allies or into towers can help avoid contact with Camille. In team fights, spreading poison on the front line while being mindful of Camille's ultimate cooldown can help mitigate her strengths."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect neutralizes Camille's reliance on auto-attacks (AA). Camille is a champion that relies heavily on AAs, and when her attacks are blocked by Teemo's Q (blind), it becomes difficult for her to deal damage. Additionally, Teemo can poke from a distance with AAs and E (poison), allowing him to deal damage before Camille can get close. Furthermore, Teemo's R (mushrooms) provides zone control, making it easier to limit Camille's movements.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Teemo should poke Camille from a distance with AAs and E, and when Camille approaches with her E, he can use Q to blind and disrupt her. After level 6, it is important to place mushrooms with R to prevent Camille from isolating him with her R. Also, engaging in prolonged fights and utilizing Camille's skill cooldowns to turn it into a war of attrition can help maintain Teemo's advantage. For item choices, selecting Nashor's Tooth and Liandry's Anguish, along with Mercury or Plated Steelcaps for boots, can effectively counter Camille's CC and physical damage.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and can deal powerful damage, especially when his HP is low. Camille is strong in short trades, but by using Warwick's W, he can target low HP enemies and gain an advantage in skirmishes while healing. Additionally, Warwick has two forms of hard crowd control, which can limit Camille's movement and suppress her mobility.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to manage minions while avoiding Camille's E in the early game. Taking damage from Camille makes healing difficult, so Warwick should use his Q to gain healing and secure an advantage in short trades. By saving his R before and after Camille's R, and using suppression at the right moment, Warwick can incapacitate Camille and deal damage. In team fights, using R from behind followed by Q to lock down a target and deal damage is effective.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has high mobility and sustained damage against Camille in the early laning phase. While Camille excels in short-term burst damage, Bloodmire can prioritize CS while utilizing healing from Q to endure and avoid prolonged fights. Additionally, by being cautious of Camille's E and R, Bloodmire can use W's invulnerability effect to dodge Camille's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, first prioritize CS during the laning phase and maneuver to avoid Camille's attacks. When reaching level 6, it is important to be wary of Camille's all-in and to counterattack after she uses her skills. Especially by utilizing your own R (Hemoplague), you can deal sustained damage in team fights while avoiding CC with W and looking for opportunities to re-engage. Furthermore, by choosing items that increase durability, you can withstand Camille's burst damage and turn the fight in your favor.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax excels in a playstyle that relies on auto-attacks (AA), and he is particularly strong against champions like Camille who are good at short trades. Jax's E can negate Camille's AAs, allowing him to mitigate her damage. Additionally, Jax has powerful burst damage after level 6, increasing his win rate in all-ins. Furthermore, Jax's passive increases his attack speed, making it easier to overcome item disparities.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to first understand Camille's E cooldown and time trades accordingly. By attacking after Camille uses her Q, you can minimize her damage while countering with Jax's E. Also, using walls to create distance can be effective in avoiding Camille's short trades. In team fights, Jax can gain the upper hand against Camille, so it is advisable to farm well in lane, create a level advantage, and then aim for an all-in.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in lane. In particular, he can poke Camille with combos using his E (Barrel), dealing damage while maintaining distance. Additionally, Camille is a melee champion, and by attacking from outside the range of Gangplank's skills, he can prevent her from closing the gap. Furthermore, Gangplank can cleanse CC and heal with his W, making him resilient against Camille's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, chip away at Camille with short pokes and place E (Barrel) near minions to zone her. It's important to be mindful of walls and terrain to avoid being stunned by Camille's E (Hookshot). After level 6, utilize Gangplank's R (Cannon Barrage) to target damage in team fights or against isolated enemies, and in one-on-one combat with Camille, pressure her early with barrels, as prolonged fights can turn unfavorable; it's best to secure safety with your ultimate before engaging. Additionally, calling for jungle intervention can effectively help to CC Camille and make her easier to take down.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has a W that can negate auto-attacks, allowing him to block Camille's auto-attacks. This helps reduce Camille's burst damage during short trades, enabling Shen to safely counterattack. Additionally, Shen's R can support allies from an infinite range, giving him significant influence in team fights and ganks. Furthermore, Shen is strong in prolonged fights and has the durability to withstand Camille's burst damage.\n\nTo maintain the advantage, from levels 1 to 5, Shen should focus on farming while saving his W and poking with Q. When Camille approaches, he can negate her auto-attacks with W and reposition with E to counterattack. After level 6, it is important to utilize Shen's R for side lane interventions, applying pressure on Camille while keeping an eye on the situation of allies. During all-ins, securing vision and confirming the position of allies before engaging can create a favorable situation against Camille.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has strong 1v1 capabilities after level 6, particularly with the ability to counter Camille's ultimate. Camille is highly mobile and excels in short trades, but Mordekaiser can leverage his shield from W and sustained damage to gain the upper hand in extended fights. Additionally, by using Mordekaiser's R, he can trap Camille in the realm of death, forcing a 1v1 situation and nullifying Camille's mobility.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to engage in a 1v1 with Camille using R once you reach level 6. By using W at full stacks and attacking after activating R, you can deal significant damage to Camille. If you have Ignite, you can suppress Camille's sustain, allowing you to gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, by choosing Bone Plating or Ravenous, you can reduce Camille's damage while continuously dealing damage yourself.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has percentage damage and true damage, which allows her to deal effective damage, especially against tanks. Additionally, by using her W (Mist), she can negate Camille's auto-attacks, making it easier to avoid her attacks. Furthermore, Gwen can use her E to reposition easily and utilize her R to dodge Camille's attacks while pursuing her.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, play cautiously and deal damage safely from a short range with Q. When Camille uses her E, deploy Mist with W to look for a chance to counterattack. It's particularly important to be wary of the second hit of Camille's Q (true damage) and maintain distance. After level 6, use R to avoid being separated and be cautious of Camille's R while timing your all-in to fight advantageously. In team fights, utilize Mist to maintain the frontline and strike from behind Camille to secure victory.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum is a durable fighter who excels in early skirmishes, making it easier to counter Camille's high burst damage. Braum's passive increases his attack speed, allowing for consecutive hits, which enables him to deal sustained damage against Camille's short trades. Additionally, Braum has a stun that immobilizes, which can limit Camille's mobility, making it easier to negate her E→Q combo.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, be cautious of Camille's second Q while using minions to trade. When Camille goes for a wall, it's important to aim for a surprise with your E and secure vision. After level 6, be careful not to get isolated by Camille's R, and leverage your sustain to engage in long fights as a winning strategy. Also, look for trades under the tower and jungle interventions to create a numerical advantage, allowing you to gain the upper hand against Camille.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and AoE damage, making him strong in engaging team fights. While Camille excels in short trades, she struggles to effectively deal damage against Sion's crowd control skills and durability. Additionally, Sion's W provides a shield and health increase, which helps mitigate Camille's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use Sion's Q for harassment in the early game while avoiding Camille's skills to deal damage. When Camille uses her W, you can take the opportunity to land your Q as a counterattack. Furthermore, by using Sion's E to pull Camille in and engaging with R, you can maintain an advantage in team fights. Specifically, targeting Camille after she uses her skills allows you to progress the fight favorably."

  "シンジド": {
    "name": "シンジド",
    "beats": {
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the sustained damage and proxy farming ability that Singed possesses. Singed excels at pushing the lane with his E and forcing Yasuo out of the minion wave. Additionally, when Yasuo enters Singed's poison area, he continues to take damage, making it difficult for him to approach. Furthermore, Singed can use slows and immobilization to limit Yasuo's movement, making it hard for Yasuo to stack his Q or aim for burst damage with his tornado. Yasuo is weak against crowd control and struggles to endure Singed's sustained damage, especially in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to be mindful of positioning in the lane and to avoid entering Singed's poison area. Using E to create distance and not chasing Singed when he is proxy farming is crucial, as is securing vision and reporting to the allied jungler. After level 6, stacking Q to aim for a knock-up with the tornado and creating opportunities for burst damage is effective. Additionally, using Wind Wall to block Singed's skills while creatively positioning yourself can help turn the matchup against Singed in your favor.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has a high ability to deal sustained damage against Kled, who lacks ranged attacks, and is particularly strong in fights within his poison. Singed's poison deals continuous damage and has a slow effect, making it difficult for Kled to approach. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed and excels at escaping, making it hard for Kled to chase him down. Furthermore, while Singed has high mana consumption, which could give Kled an advantage in prolonged fights, if Singed plays well, Kled will struggle.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming and be cautious not to enter Singed's poison. If Singed is proxy farming, it may be worth ignoring him and farming in other lanes. It is also crucial to read Singed's skills and avoid Gragas's abilities. Purchasing Tiamat early and securing CS while avoiding contact with Singed can gradually create a more favorable situation. Additionally, utilizing the cooldowns of Singed's skills to identify opportunities for attack can be effective.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed is strong in prolonged fights and has a high ability to deal sustained damage, making it difficult for Gwen to approach and engage. Stepping on Singed's Q (poison) puts Gwen at a disadvantage in extended trades, and even using Gwen's W (mist) carries the risk of being slammed into walls or towers by Singed's E (fling). Additionally, Singed excels at proxy farming, allowing him to continue farming even when he leaves the lane, making it hard for Gwen to establish an advantage in lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to pull the minions towards yourself early in the lane to prevent proxy farming and to be cautious not to linger in Singed's Q (poison). By poking with Q in small bursts and using E to safely engage or disengage, you can repeatedly engage in short trades to avoid Singed's sustained damage. After level 6, you can utilize your R to aim for follow-up plays, and in team fights, targeting multiple enemies in the center can increase your chances of countering Singed.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has ranged attack capabilities and fights while spreading poison, making it very difficult for Warwick to get close. Singed's sustained damage and slow effects prevent Warwick from maintaining proximity, making it hard for him to deal damage. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed, so even if Warwick tries to stick to him with his E, there is a high chance he will escape. Furthermore, Singed has high mana consumption, allowing him to fight continuously, while Warwick's short skill range and vulnerability to crowd control and kiting also contribute to his weaknesses.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important not to force engagements and to use minions to maintain healing while avoiding Singed's skills. By using hooks and bushes to set up ambushes, you can create favorable situations against Singed. Additionally, gaining backup from the jungle can apply pressure on Singed and increase opportunities for trades. Furthermore, building items focused on health can enhance durability, making it easier to counter Singed's sustained damage.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed lacks ranged attack options and can only deal damage by getting close, while Singed's sustained damage and high movement speed are troublesome for Renekton. Singed can use slows and immobilization to limit Renekton's movement and gain an advantage by dragging the fight into a prolonged engagement. Additionally, by proxy farming, Singed makes it difficult for Renekton to push the lane, reducing his ability to roam and impact other lanes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to push the wave first to prevent Singed from proxy farming. Renekton should utilize his Q for healing, deal damage with W, and use E for blinking to gain an advantage in trades. Choosing PTA can increase damage against Singed and create opportunities to whittle down his HP. Furthermore, using Fleet Footwork or Ghost can make it easier to chase and limit Singed's movement. By calmly utilizing minions and avoiding macro wars with Singed, Renekton can leverage his strengths effectively.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Singed's sustained damage and high mobility. Singed fights by spreading poison, making it difficult for Malphite to approach, especially since avoiding the poison line from Singed's W is challenging. Additionally, Singed can continuously deal damage to Malphite, who has no ranged attacks, making it easier for Singed to gain an advantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Singed's catch potential using slows and immobilization is troublesome for Malphite.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, freeze the minion wave at the start of the lane to prevent Singed from proxy farming. Next, it is important to avoid Singed's poison line while using Q to apply slows and trading with E's melee damage. After level 6, save R and coordinate with allies to isolate Singed for a potential burst kill. Additionally, purchasing a Bramble Vest to suppress Singed's healing can be effective. In team fights, using R to control Singed and avoid prolonged engagements is essential.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed creates an environment that makes it easy to deal sustained damage to Mordekaiser, who has no ranged attacks. Singed's playstyle of spreading poison makes it difficult for Mordekaiser to approach, especially as Singed's slows and immobilization restrict Mordekaiser's movement. Additionally, Singed has high mobility, giving him an advantage when escaping. Furthermore, Singed can continuously deal damage to Mordekaiser, who has high mana consumption, making it likely for Mordekaiser to remain in a disadvantageous situation during extended fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to adopt a turtle strategy in the lane, avoiding Singed's attacks while farming. Playing defensively until level 6, farming with Q, and observing Singed's movements is crucial. Prioritizing the purchase of Rylais for sustained healing can also help gain an advantage in trades against Singed. Additionally, allowing Singed to push and adjusting your position to consider where you might get flipped can help avoid Singed's attacks. Utilizing your R at level 6 to isolate Singed can also be effective in aiming for a one-on-one victory.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has no ranged attack options, and Garen, who can only deal damage by getting close, finds Singed's persistent damage from his poison very troublesome. Additionally, Singed can use slows and immobilization to restrict Garen's movement, making it difficult for him to approach. Furthermore, Singed excels at proxy farming, which poses a risk of losing farm even if Garen pushes the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. From the start of the lane until level 3, avoid pushing the minions too much and be careful not to stand on Singed's poison for too long.\n2. Save Q (Silence) to stop Singed's Q (Fling) and use it at the right moment.\n3. After level 6, when aiming for a kill with R, be mindful to use R followed by Flash to chase if your HP is low.\n4. If proxy farming occurs, either call your jungler for help or freeze the lane yourself to farm safely.\n5. Experiment with builds and runes, opting for Mercury's Treads and Black Cleaver to increase durability.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed's sustained damage and crowd control skill, Fling, make it difficult for Irelia to approach. Singed fights while spreading poison, so when Irelia gets close, she will continuously take damage from the poison. Additionally, if Singed disrupts her position with Fling, Irelia will lose her advantage in short trades and may find herself in a disadvantageous situation. Furthermore, by opting for a tanky build, Singed can reduce Irelia's damage and excel in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early game, focus on minion management and prioritize safely farming with Q. Be cautious of Singed's poison range and avoid unnecessary approaches.\n2. Look for opportunities to chip away at Singed's HP with short combos (E→Q→AA) around levels 2-3. However, be very careful of Fling's positioning.\n3. When using R at level 6 to go all-in, maneuver to minimize the impact of Singed's poison.\n4. Purchase Mercury's Treads or health-oriented armor to increase resistance against Fling and sustained damage.\n5. In team fights, aim to target the squishy backline while utilizing the chaos created by Singed, and move to avoid his crowd control.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed's sustained damage and high mobility make it difficult to keep approaching him. Singed excels at proxy farming while avoiding Gragas's attacks and dragging the fight into a war of attrition. Additionally, when Gragas is thrown back by Singed's Fling, he loses the opportunity to counterattack. Furthermore, Singed can create situations where he can continuously deal damage to Gragas, who has no ranged attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively use wards from the early game to keep track of Singed's movements. Gragas can poke from a distance with his Q to deter Singed's movements. It is also crucial to close the gap with E and look for opportunities to counterattack while healing with W. When Singed jumps in with E, being cautious of Fling and positioning properly can increase the chances of a counterattack. In the mid-game, building MR can effectively reduce Singed's damage and help drag the fight into a longer engagement.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Singed's persistent poison damage and proxy farming ability give him an advantage over Shen's short-term taunt and support capabilities. Singed has high movement speed and sustained damage, making it difficult for Shen to approach, forcing him to fight while taking damage from Singed's poison. Additionally, if Shen is pushed into towers or allies by Singed's fling, he finds himself in a very unfavorable situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to manage minions thoroughly in the early lane phase, disrupting Singed's proxy by freezing or pushing back. It is also effective to time a counterattack after provoking Singed's taunt, aiming for short trades while using the shield from W. Furthermore, in terms of item selection, choosing items like Bramble Vest or Thornmail, and focusing on magic resistance items against AP can enhance durability. By being cautious of Singed's roams and prioritizing rescue from allies' ultimates, you can steer the overall game situation in your favor.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed's high sustained damage and crowd control skills make it difficult for Quinn to approach. Singed spreads poison with his Q and can hold Quinn in place with his W, making it hard for Quinn to land attacks. Additionally, Singed has high durability as a tank, allowing him to absorb Quinn's burst damage more easily. Furthermore, Singed's slows and immobilization restrict Quinn's mobility, making it difficult for her to escape.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to poke with Q over minions while avoiding Singed's poison trail. Next, using E to sidestep while auto-attacking is necessary to evade Singed's attacks. It is also crucial to conserve Flash and have an escape plan ready in case Singed manages to hold Quinn in place. Additionally, after pushing the lane, actively roaming to other lanes can increase influence and help avoid one-on-one situations with Singed.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the high sustained damage and mobility that Singed possesses. Singed fights by spreading poison, making it difficult for Ornn to approach, especially when Singed can throw him near towers or allies with his Fling, which makes Ornn susceptible to damage. Additionally, Singed can easily create an experience gap by proxy farming, making it hard for Ornn to maintain the lane. Furthermore, Singed's ability to catch with slows and immobilization makes it challenging for Ornn to engage in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Ornn to be wary of Singed's proxy from the early game and to use wards to secure vision. Also, he should aim to limit Singed's movement with his E and deal damage with short combos (Q→E→W). In team fights, it is crucial to use his R to catch Singed and create opportunities to deal damage in coordination with allies. Additionally, preparing tank items early to increase durability will help Ornn withstand Singed's sustained damage.",
      "アンベッサ": "Ambessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Singed's high sustained damage and movement speed, as well as his lane control through proxy farming. Singed fights by spreading poison, making it difficult for Ambessa to approach, especially since Ambessa lacks ranged attacks and is susceptible to Singed's poison damage. Additionally, Singed's slows and immobilization make it hard for Ambessa to escape. Furthermore, Singed excels in prolonged fights, often outmatching Ambessa's short-term damage output.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to be wary of Singed's proxy farming from the early game and to report to the allied jungle for support. In lane, use Q and E to manage minions and build up your passive in preparation for a counterattack. It is also important to use W to shield yourself before taking damage from Singed, ensuring your survival. In the mid-game, avoid short skirmishes with Singed, utilize E's slow to catch him, and position yourself to secure kills from a distance with R. Additionally, purchasing Mercury or Bramble items early can effectively reduce Singed's poison damage while disrupting his healing.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed lacks ranged attack options and excels at dealing sustained damage. Jax cannot deal damage without getting close, making it difficult to approach Singed while taking his poison, especially when Singed's slows and immobilization restrict Jax's movement, preventing him from engaging. Additionally, Singed is strong in prolonged fights and has resistance to the burst damage that Jax possesses. Furthermore, Singed is skilled at proxy farming, making it hard for Jax to push the lane.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to buy Mercury's Treads early to reduce the impact of slows and crowd control. Also, purchasing Tiamat to clear waves quickly allows Jax to push ahead of Singed, taking advantage of his proxy farming. Moreover, when Singed goes to mid, it is crucial to push the lane and deal damage to the tower, creating a favorable situation before he returns. Being mindful of holding the side lanes while warning teammates can also be effective.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has no ranged attack options and cannot deal damage unless he gets close, making it difficult to avoid Singed's poison. Additionally, Singed excels at dealing sustained damage and is strong in prolonged fights. K'Sante has a short range, and especially when affected by Singed's poison, he continues to take damage, making it hard to approach. Furthermore, Singed's slows and immobilization restrict K'Sante's movement, preventing him from fighting effectively.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial not to chase Singed. It is necessary to intentionally avoid his poison and avoid harassment under the tower. Prioritizing farming is also important; while Singed is proxy farming, K'Sante should focus on killing minions and leave dealing with the jungler to his teammates. In terms of itemization, purchasing Frostfire can increase K'Sante's durability against Singed and utilize the slow effect to limit his movement. Proper lane management is essential, and if Singed starts proxy farming, it is important to calmly continue farming and avoid unnecessary fights.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Singed's ranged attack capabilities and high escape potential. Singed fights by spreading poison along his path, making it difficult for Darius to approach, especially when Singed uses his slows and immobilization, which makes Darius more susceptible to attacks. Additionally, Singed excels at dealing sustained damage and is strong in prolonged fights, while Darius relies on short trades, putting him at a disadvantage in a war of attrition against Singed.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Minion Management**: If Singed is proxy farming, it is important to freeze the minions to reduce his opportunities to gain experience. This can help curb Singed's growth.\n2. **Utilize Ganks**: Coordinating with the jungler to gank Singed can neutralize his escape potential and create opportunities for kills.\n3. **Item Selection**: It is crucial to purchase durability items like Black Cleaver or Sterak's Gage early to withstand Singed's sustained damage.\n4. **Be Aware of Level Differences**: After level 6, it is effective to look for opportunities to engage using your ultimate, ensuring that Singed cannot escape.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has high pushing power in the early game, which may not give Nar enough time to stack his Q. Singed's sustained damage and mobility allow for proxy farming and roaming, making Nar susceptible to pressure in lane. Additionally, Singed's slows and crowd control with his immobilization make it difficult for Nar to approach, especially in mini-Nar form, where he is particularly weak in all-ins.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to start with Doran's Shield to withstand early harassment. Freezing the lane and safely stacking Q under the tower can help increase stacks. Also, avoiding Singed's proxy farming and notifying the jungle for support from teammates can be effective. In terms of build, prioritizing Mercury's Treads and magic resistance, while choosing tankier items, can increase durability and allow Nar to delay Singed's escape in team fights with his W.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Singed's sustained damage and high mobility. Singed fights by spreading poison, making it difficult for Aatrox to get close, especially since touching Singed's trail results in continuous damage. Additionally, Singed's slows and immobilization often hinder Aatrox's attacks, making it hard to leverage his advantage in close combat. Furthermore, while Singed lacks ranged attacks, if Aatrox can consistently close the gap, he can gain an advantage; however, the opportunities to do so are reduced by Singed's sustained damage and crowd control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to freeze the wave and deny CS. This makes it harder for Singed to farm. When Singed attacks, using Q in the opposite direction beforehand allows Aatrox to avoid Singed's attacks while still being able to retaliate if flipped. Additionally, having a Doran's Shield and Second Wind makes it easier to deal with Singed's sustained damage. If Singed tries to escape, it can be effective to not chase but instead focus on attacking to drain the opponent's resources. By employing these strategies, you can turn the matchup against Singed in your favor.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed's persistent poison damage and crowd control skill, Fling (W), make it difficult for Mundo to approach. Singed can continuously spread poison trails from a distance, chipping away at Mundo's HP while applying sustained pressure on Mundo, who has self-healing capabilities. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed, allowing him to escape when Mundo tries to engage, making it hard for Mundo to create advantageous situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Adjusting the build: It is important to purchase magic resistance items early (e.g., Spirit Visage or Adaptive Helm) to reduce Singed's poison damage.\n2. Lane positioning: Avoiding Singed's poison trails while attacking from a distance with Q (Cleave) and timing all-ins when Singed's Fling (W) is on cooldown is crucial.\n3. Role in team fights: By not triggering Singed's R and coordinating with allies to target Singed, you can reduce his impact."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nThe reason Teemo is favored against Singed is mainly due to his long-range sustained poke ability and blind effect. By using Teemo's Q (Blind), he can nullify Singed's basic attacks and deal continuous damage. Additionally, Teemo can secure vision by placing mushrooms, which helps limit Singed's movements, making it easier to maintain lane dominance.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to always keep your distance and initiate with Q. When Singed approaches, use Q to blind him, and then follow up with basic attacks and W (movement speed boost) to deal damage. Also, placing mushrooms in front can deal damage while securing vision when Singed tries to proxy farm. Since Singed becomes stronger in prolonged fights, calling for jungle support early can also be effective.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has powerful harassment capabilities in the early game due to his range and short-term skirmishing. Singed struggles significantly when he has to approach to deal damage, as he will take damage from Jayce's ranged attacks. Additionally, Jayce has a short cooldown on his skills, and harassment using his Q (Acceleration Gate) is particularly effective. While Singed is strong against sustained damage, Jayce can deal short-term burst damage, allowing him to inflict damage before Singed can get close.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (levels 1-3), it is important to harass Singed with auto-attacks followed by Q (Acceleration Gate) while using minions to maintain distance. Be cautious of Singed's proxy farming and use wards to secure vision. In the mid-game (around level 6), position yourself to avoid being pulled in by Singed's fling, and continue to harass using long-range E and Q. In team fights, instead of trying to take down Singed first, it is key to work with your teammates to prevent being split up and utilize Jayce's mobility to secure victory.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen can attack from a distance and deal sustained damage to Singed using his skills. In particular, Kennen's ultimate has high crowd control in team fights, allowing him to restrict Singed's movement while dealing damage to allies. Additionally, Singed needs to stay close to be effective, so Kennen's ranged attacks can help him avoid Singed's harassment.\n\nTo take advantage, first poke Singed with Q and auto-attacks during the laning phase, managing minions while avoiding counterattacks with W. Freezing the minion wave is crucial to prevent Singed's proxy farming and create an XP lead. In trades, use W and E to safely deal damage and disengage quickly. If the jungler comes, prepare to use R after W to catch multiple enemies, and if you have Zhonya, you can survive. In team fights, entering from the side and using R to stun enemies is key to making it easier for your allies' carries to deal damage.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Kail can attack from range, allowing her to deal sustained damage while avoiding Singed's melee attacks. Additionally, by utilizing her R skill, which grants invulnerability, she can more easily evade Singed's slows and attacks. Furthermore, since Singed needs to stay close to be effective, Kail can maintain distance while attacking, giving her an advantageous position.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to farm carefully until reaching level 6 and to avoid Singed's attacks. After Singed uses his slow, hitting him with her Q allows Kail to apply a slow effect on him while keeping her distance. Also, saving her W to prepare for escape and using her R to become invulnerable when Singed attacks can create opportunities for counterattacks. As she levels up, she can establish dominance over Singed, so properly farming and growing is key to achieving victory.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has range and can deal sustained damage to Singed. Since Singed needs to stay close to be effective in fights, Urgot can safely farm while using his ranged attacks to limit Singed's movements. Additionally, Urgot can catch Singed with his CC skill (E) and follow up for easier damage.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize farming first and deal damage with Q when Singed approaches. Look for opportunities to catch Singed with E after he uses his skills or when he is low on mana, and deal damage with R to create a favorable situation against him. Also, be careful not to get flipped under the tower, and even if Singed is proxy farming, it’s important to prioritize your own farm rather than chasing him unnecessarily. As Urgot becomes stronger in the late game, applying pressure from early to mid-game is key to achieving victory.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in the lane. Singed can only deal damage if he gets close, so by using Gangplank's Q to attack from a distance, he can play favorably against Singed. Additionally, Gangplank's W allows him to cleanse crowd control while healing, which gives him high survivability even when affected by Singed's slows and immobilizations.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to farm in front of the tower at the start, and if Singed is proxy farming, waiting and calling the jungler is crucial. Setting up a barrel at level 2 and harassing with Q when Singed enters the fling range is effective, allowing you to deal damage while maintaining distance. Choosing items like \"Death's Dance\" and \"Teleport\" is also important to secure farm even if Singed proxies. As the game progresses, Gangplank will outdamage Singed, so avoiding damage as much as possible in the early game to scale is key.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and strong crowd control, allowing him to withstand Singed's sustained damage. Additionally, by using W (Silence) when Singed approaches, he can disable Singed's skills and gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, Cho'Gath excels at short engagements, which can disrupt Singed's preference for prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to manage the wave with E in the early game and initiate short skirmishes. After silencing Singed with W, you can deal damage with E while incorporating auto-attacks. It's crucial to avoid lingering in Singed's poison (Q) and to be mindful of positioning during fights. When Singed gets close, aim for a knock-up with Q and either finish him off or coordinate an attack with allies. In terms of item selection, prioritize HP, magic resistance, and crowd control countermeasures, considering items like Bramble Vest, Ninja Tabi, and magic resist gear to fight more effectively.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has a W (Riposte) that can parry Singed's skills, allowing her to negate Singed's fling and secure a stun, putting her in a favorable position. Additionally, Fiora has sustained healing capabilities, making it easier for her to deal with Singed's poison damage over time. Furthermore, Fiora can showcase her strength in one-on-one situations, allowing her to maneuver advantageously in a 1v1 against Singed.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, use Q to dodge Singed's auto-attacks while trading. Save W to avoid flings and strong CC, using it in response when Singed attacks. During an all-in, aim for Singed's weak points with R and use W to counter the fling, which can secure the fight. If Singed is proxy farming, it's important to prioritize safety under the tower while gaining an experience lead. In team fights, focus on targeting carries from the side, being mindful of Singed's poison and ranged damage, and timing your engagement well.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick's Maiden and split-pushing are powerful in team fights, and he can handle Singed directly with ease. Yorick's poke with E and sustain with Q serve as means to counter Singed's sustained damage. Additionally, since Singed needs to stay close to be effective, trades using Yorick's wall and attacks with his pets work to Yorick's advantage.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to prioritize minion management in the early lane phase and prevent Singed's proxy farming. Poke Singed with E, follow up with auto-attacks, and secure sustain with Q. After level 6, utilize the Maiden for split-pushing, aiming to take down Singed alone or calling for allies to initiate a team fight. Also, securing vision and being wary of Singed's roams can create a more favorable situation.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has very high burst damage, especially in the early game, making it easier to secure kills against Singed. While Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, he often cannot withstand Pantheon's burst damage. Additionally, Pantheon has a targeted leap (E) and a stun (W), which makes it easier to limit Singed's movements and gain an advantage during all-ins.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively trade from levels 1 to 3 to chip away at Singed's health. Specifically, after dealing damage with Q, landing a stun with W, and closing the distance with E to execute a combo can deal significant damage to Singed. After level 6, using R to roam to other lanes and expand influence is effective. When Singed is proxy farming, managing vision while limiting his movements can help secure an overall advantage in the match.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage and strong traits for short trades. While Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, Camille can leverage her passive shield to gain an advantage in short-term trades. Additionally, by using Camille's E for long-range blink, it becomes easier to avoid Singed's fling and maintain an edge in close combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively engage in attacks at levels 1 and 2 to pressure Singed. To avoid Singed's fling, prepare to escape by using E just before the animation starts, and cancel the fling to progress the trade favorably. Furthermore, since Singed has high mana consumption, attacking early can effectively deplete his resources. This allows Camille to secure an advantage in the lane more easily.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has long-range sustained damage and can disrupt Singed's approach. Since Singed cannot deal damage without getting close, Rumble can limit Singed's movements by using his skills to harass while maintaining distance. Additionally, Rumble has no skill costs and short cooldowns, making it easy to attack continuously.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, harass Singed solo from the side of the minions with E (Electro-Harpoon) while prioritizing Heat management. If Singed attempts to proxy, either burn the escape route with R or call for help to deal with him. It becomes troublesome when he gets close, so if he approaches, use W to gain movement speed and deal damage with Q and E while retreating. If you get flipped, it's crucial to use W immediately to create distance. For the item build, choose Liandry's as the core item, and then purchase Rylai's or Zhonya's to ensure sustained damage and survivability. After level 6, utilize R in team fights to suppress Singed.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf is strong in short-term skirmishes and can increase his attack power while negating crowd control with his ultimate. Singed fights by spreading poison from a distance, but Olaf can approach and attack even while taking that poison, becoming particularly powerful as his health decreases, making it easier to counter Singed's sustained damage. Additionally, Olaf's Q can apply a slow, limiting Singed's movement and allowing for follow-up attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, place a ward at the start to watch for Singed's proxy. In lane, use E to secure last hits while applying a slow with Q, aiming for short-term skirmishes with the A→E combo. After Singed uses his flip (W), use R at the right moment to negate crowd control and attack with full force. From mid to late game, focus on breaking the front line first in side pushes and team fights, prioritizing armor penetration and sustain against heavily armored opponents.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire can avoid Singed's Fling by using W (Pool), which increases his resilience in close combat. Additionally, Bloodmire has sustain from Q, making it easier to counter Singed's continuous damage. Furthermore, when Singed is proxy farming, Bloodmire can push the minions early to disrupt Singed's farming.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize securing minions in the early lane phase and stabilize CS with Q. When Singed attempts to proxy, pushing the minions early and waiting for a tower dive or TP can apply pressure on Singed. Also, when Singed is charging E, using W to negate Fling and then building up damage with E to engage in short trades is effective. After level 6, using R to heal while engaging in 1v1 can be advantageous, while also being mindful of ally interventions."

    "beats": {
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high mobility and sustained damage of Anvessa. Anvessa has dashes attached to all of his skills, giving him an advantage in close combat. In particular, when Anvessa uses his dash to avoid Cho'Gath's skills and closes in, Cho'Gath is likely to lose opportunities for counterattacks. Additionally, by avoiding Cho'Gath's W (Silence) and Q (Knock-Up), Anvessa can attack freely, making it easier to chip away at Cho'Gath's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to keep the following points in mind. First, in the early game, use E and Q to farm and harass, while keeping Anvessa's charges in check. Look for opportunities to counterattack after Anvessa uses his skills, and deal damage with the Q→W combo. Also, by using W (Silence) to disrupt Anvessa's charges and R, you can limit his attacks. Furthermore, be mindful of your positioning in the minion wave and secure vision in the bushes to strengthen coordination with your jungler and increase pressure on Anvessa.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that the high mobility and suppression effect (R) of Anvessa are very troublesome for Fiora's combat style. Anvessa has dashes attached to all of her skills, making it difficult for Fiora to approach. Additionally, Anvessa's R cannot be negated by Fiora's parry (W), so when R is used, Fiora is temporarily incapacitated and loses the chance to counterattack. Furthermore, Fiora lacks AoE attacks, which slows her wave clear, allowing Anvessa to take advantageous positions using minions.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, in the early stages of laning, it is important to keep the minions close to your side and avoid long trades. Try to predict Anvessa's Q and E, and conserve W to win short skirmishes. Also, understanding the cooldown of Anvessa's R and being aggressive when it is unavailable can be effective. Additionally, choosing summoner spells like Flash and Ignite, and placing wards to be cautious of ganks, can help you lane more safely.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anvessa has high mobility and damage from the early game, making it easy to apply pressure in the lane. In particular, Anvessa's R ability, which provides suppression, limits Kail's actions and takes away her chances to counterattack. Additionally, Kail is very weak in the early game and remains at a disadvantage against other champions until she reaches level 6. Furthermore, Kail lacks hard crowd control, making her susceptible to Anvessa's attacks, especially against opponents with burst damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to safely farm minions in the early game and avoid skirmishes. Placing wards to watch for jungle interference and enduring until level 6 is crucial. After reaching level 6, focus on safely poking with your range and aim to deal sustained DPS from the backline in team fights. It is also important to monitor and predict Anvessa's R usage to disengage effectively. Once you have your core items, it is effective to attack while utilizing your range and maneuvering to avoid Anvessa's attacks.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone faces increased risks in close combat due to Anvessa's high mobility and suppression from her ultimate. Anvessa has dashes attached to all her skills, giving her excellent chasing and escaping capabilities. In contrast, Yone is highly reliant on items and struggles in lane combat until he is fully equipped. Additionally, it is difficult to avoid Anvessa's skills, and when restricted by the suppression from her ultimate, Yone cannot unleash his strength of high DPS.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm from a distance with Q in the early game and avoid unnecessary close combat. It is effective to wait for a moment when Anvessa has used her skills and then jump in with E to deal short-term damage before quickly retreating. Furthermore, after level 6, using R to aim for a knock-up and coordinating with allies to either force Anvessa to use her ultimate or go for a kill is beneficial. Additionally, utilizing the shield from W to avoid counterattacks and baiting Anvessa's skills can help reduce risks.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anvessa has abundant dash abilities, making it very difficult to land Sion's Q. All of Anvessa's skills come with a blink, allowing her to easily avoid Sion's attacks, and especially in lane, her mobility provides a significant advantage. Additionally, Anvessa has high short-term damage output, which can effectively deal damage against Sion's tank build. Furthermore, while Anvessa consumes a lot of energy, allowing for opportunities to exploit her cooldowns, it is challenging to predict her dashes, making it easy to miss counterattack opportunities.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on short-term trades in the laning phase and use crowd control to deal damage all at once. Additionally, purchasing Iceborn Gauntlet can improve mobility when chasing or escaping from Anvessa. In a tank build, avoiding Heartsteel and prioritizing Iceborn Gauntlet or Thornmail can enhance durability while keeping damage in check. By leveraging macro play and coordinating with the team, it is possible to relatively diminish Anvessa's strengths.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anvessa has high mobility and all of her skills include dashes, making it easy to avoid Mundo's attacks. Additionally, Anvessa's R ability can potentially negate Mundo's healing capabilities, which can be fatal, especially in team fights. Furthermore, Anvessa can easily gain an advantage in early trades, dealing damage before Mundo's healing is fully established, often causing the early lane disadvantage to affect the entire game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm carefully in the early lane phase while poking with Q and maintaining healing. Utilizing minions to position oneself and avoiding risky trades is necessary to dodge Anvessa's skills. Moreover, in the mid to late lane phase, using W and R to prolong trades and close the health gap can be effective. In team fights, it is crucial to provide sustain as a tank at the front line and to quickly assist allies who are suppressed by Anvessa's R.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ambessa's high mobility and suppression effect from his ultimate make it easy to disrupt Bloodmire's actions. Ambessa has dashes attached to all of his skills, allowing him to gain an advantage in short trades. While Bloodmire has sustained healing capabilities, he can be suppressed by Ambessa's ultimate when taking damage, making it difficult to counterattack. Additionally, Bloodmire has a long cooldown in the early game and low damage, which makes it easy to lose lane control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm safely with Q while maintaining distance in the early game, and to conserve W (pool) to avoid Ambessa's ultimate and charges. Hitting Q over minions allows you to deal damage while maneuvering safely. In the mid to late game, aim for extended fights using your ultimate, and by sidestepping or using the pool to avoid Ambessa's ultimate, you can look for a comeback in team fights. Purchasing armor (MR/HP) early to increase durability is also effective.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high mobility and short-term damage output of Anvessa. Anvessa has dashes attached to all of their skills, making it easy to approach while avoiding Nar's attacks. Additionally, Anvessa's R (Suppression) poses a risk of restricting Nar's actions. In mini form, Nar has low base stats and is weak to all-ins, making them susceptible to Anvessa's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to focus on poking in the early lane phase, using Q and W to maintain distance while attacking. It's also necessary to refrain from attacking after Anvessa uses their W (Shield) and to avoid risky trades. Managing the timing of Mega form effectively is crucial, as well as utilizing Mega Nar's W and R in team fights to provide crowd control and contribute to the team. Furthermore, using Flash and allies' CC to evade Anvessa's attacks can also be effective.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anvessa has high mobility and all of her skills come with dashes, making it easy for her to avoid Ornn's crowd control. In particular, Anvessa's R ability can potentially negate Ornn's engage in team fights. Additionally, Ornn has many skills that require preparation to apply crowd control, which makes him vulnerable to Anvessa's attacks due to his lack of burst potential. Furthermore, Ornn's skill cooldowns are relatively long, especially since he relies heavily on his R, and missing the right timing can lead to unfavorable situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on short trades from the early game, gradually whittling down health with a Q→AA combo. Also, by taking advantage of the brief window after Anvessa uses her passive to initiate short skirmishes, you can create opportunities to gain an advantage. After level 6, using your R to stop Anvessa's charge and utilizing crowd control in team fights to protect your allies is essential. Additionally, gathering items early to become tanky and increasing your durability can improve your survival rate in team fights.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Anvessa's high mobility and pursuit power, which she utilizes with her dashes. Anvessa has a blink on all her skills, and her damage output in close combat is very high, making it easy for her to close the distance even if Malphite tries to keep away. Additionally, Malphite's hard CC is only on his R, and if Anvessa can avoid his skills, he becomes more susceptible to her attacks. Furthermore, Malphite has a weakness against AP champions, and since Anvessa's damage relies on AP, this affects his damage output during the laning phase.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, during the laning phase, it is crucial to use Q to poke from a distance and suppress Anvessa's approach. Additionally, using E to farm safely and utilizing W for shields to increase durability is effective. Moreover, timing the use of R correctly and counterattacking after Anvessa has used her skills can reduce the risk of taking her attacks. By coordinating with allies' CC and aiming for an early knock-up in team fights, it is possible to suppress Anvessa's carry potential.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that the suppression from Anvessa's ultimate restricts Yasuo's actions, making him particularly vulnerable when caught, which can lead to a rapid weakening. Additionally, Anvessa's high chasing power, enhanced by her dash, can put Yasuo at a disadvantage during trades. Furthermore, Anvessa has high base damage, and her passive charge strengthens her basic attacks, which adds risk when Yasuo tries to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to safely farm using E through minions in the early game and to maintain distance when Anvessa uses her skills. Utilizing Wind Wall to block Anvessa's Q and attacking after her W shield has been consumed during trades is advisable. After level 6, it is crucial to prioritize monitoring Anvessa's ultimate, looking for opportunities to counterattack after she uses it. In team fights, instead of focusing on taking down Anvessa first, aim for stable knock-ups using your allies' crowd control, and strive to turn the game in your favor with Yasuo's ultimate.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anvessa has high mobility and sustained damage in the mid to late game. Pantheon excels in short-term burst damage in the early game, but Anvessa can use her W to shield herself and withstand Pantheon's burst damage. Additionally, by utilizing Anvessa's E for dashes and slow effects, she can avoid Pantheon's attacks while counterattacking. Furthermore, Anvessa can use her R to dive behind Pantheon, creating opportunities to turn the game in her favor.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on the following points. First, in the early lane phase, apply pressure actively, poke with Q, and aim for stuns with W to prevent Anvessa from activating her passive. Next, attack immediately after Anvessa uses her W shield, timing your damage to ignore the shield. Also, by utilizing your own R to roam to other lanes, you can create advantages in side lanes, potentially changing the flow of the entire game. In the mid to late game, it is crucial to avoid overcommitting and aim for secure damage at short ranges.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anvessa has high mobility and all of her skills come with dashes, making it easy to avoid Gragas's attacks. In particular, Gragas's Q has a slow cast time, and it is difficult to deal damage unless he restricts the opponent's movement, while Anvessa can quickly close the gap and initiate trades. Additionally, Gragas has low DPS and struggles with all-ins, putting him at a disadvantage in brawls against Anvessa. Furthermore, Gragas's R for disruption is not effective against Anvessa's Ult suppression, which could lead to difficulties in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to poke with Q while maintaining distance and to time the use of E for escaping. Utilizing the shield from W is also necessary to withstand Anvessa's attacks. In terms of item build, choosing tank items to increase durability is effective for improving sustain. Summoners should select Flash and Ignite to ensure escape options depending on the situation.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high mobility and dash capabilities that Anvessa possesses. Anvessa has dashes attached to all of their skills, making them proficient in close-range trades. In particular, the suppression from their ultimate can temporarily incapacitate Quinn, effectively shutting down her hit-and-run tactics. Additionally, by dragging the fight into a prolonged engagement, Anvessa can utilize their passive to deal sustained damage, which may turn the tables on Quinn even if she attempts short trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is crucial for Quinn to maintain distance using her Q and basic attacks to avoid Anvessa's approach. Using her E to reduce incoming damage and safely trading with the help of minions is necessary. Furthermore, utilizing her R to roam in side lanes and aiming for kills in other lanes can enhance her overall impact. Additionally, in terms of item selection, choosing gear that maintains mobility while providing instant damage can help Quinn gain an advantage in her matchup against Anvessa."

    "loses": {
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's Q (Blind) can neutralize Anvessa's AA (auto attacks). Anvessa is an AA-dependent champion, and Teemo's blind effect significantly reduces his damage. Additionally, Teemo has ranged attacks, allowing him to harass Anvessa from a safe distance, making it easier to maintain lane dominance.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use Q for harassment early on and attack from behind minions. Between levels 2 and 3, keep your distance while assessing Anvessa's Q and E skills, and play safely while securing vision with W. In the mid-game, place mushrooms (R) on the sides to block approach paths, limiting Anvessa's movements. Furthermore, when Anvessa charges in, use blind to negate his attacks and create opportunities for counterattacks. In team fights, targeting healers or CC champions from the side lanes while controlling vision with mushrooms and restricting enemy movements is effective.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has short burst damage and crowd control, allowing her to deal damage before Anvessa can utilize her mobility. Riven's W stun can negate Anvessa's dash and create opportunities for attacks. Additionally, Riven can maximize her damage by chaining her skills, making it possible to deal significant damage before Anvessa can retaliate.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, use Q to farm minions while dealing chip damage with a short combo (Q → AA → Q). It's important to save E and aim for a stun in sync with Anvessa's W explosion. After level 6, Anvessa's R becomes a threat, so it's effective to engage during her R cooldown. When R is available, avoid overextending, use wards to ensure safety, and be cautious not to get isolated. In team fights, it's crucial to prevent Anvessa from diving into the enemy backline with R before she engages, and after she dives in, quickly deal damage and aim for kills.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage, which is particularly effective against single targets. To counter Anvessa's sustained damage, Camille excels in short trades and can use her E to jump over walls or aim for stuns, allowing her to avoid Anvessa's attacks while dealing damage. Additionally, Camille's R has the ability to immobilize enemies, which can be used to eliminate Anvessa early on.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early lane phase, use E to jump over walls while avoiding Anvessa's skills and deal short-term damage with Q. When Anvessa is charging her skills, it's important to use the second hit of Q to deal damage while creating distance with E. In the mid-game, you need to be cautious of Anvessa's R while trying to take the initiative with burst damage. In team fights, prioritize isolating Anvessa, immobilizing her with R, and eliminating her immediately to secure an advantage for the entire team.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton is extremely powerful in the early levels, especially in trades from level 1 to level 3. Renekton's W has a shield-reducing effect, which can negate Anvessa's sustain. Additionally, Renekton can use Fury to enhance his skills, allowing him to deal sustained damage while also healing, giving him high durability in lane. Furthermore, by using Renekton's CC skill, E, he can limit Anvessa's movements and gain an advantage in trades.\n\nTo take advantage, first, Renekton should zone at level 1 to prevent Anvessa from getting close. After level 2, he can use W to reduce shields and approach with E to initiate trades. It's important to manage Fury while executing combos to chip away at the opponent's HP. Also, by approaching after Anvessa uses his dash, Renekton can create a situation where Anvessa cannot escape, gaining an advantage. The timing of using Renekton's ultimate is also crucial, as it increases his durability and prepares him for tower dives or team fights.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen's Q silence can disrupt Anvessa's skill activation. Anvessa has high mobility, but Garen's silence makes it difficult for her to utilize that mobility. Additionally, Garen excels at dealing sustained damage, and especially in one-on-one situations, he can deliver a powerful blow to Anvessa using his R, which deals true damage. Furthermore, Garen has high durability and is good at lane maintenance, making it easier for him to gain an advantage in early trades.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from the start of the lane until level 3, use E to clear minions while applying silence with Q to prevent Anvessa from activating her skills. From level 3 to level 6, it is important to push with E while poking from outside Anvessa's attack range. By saving Q for Anvessa's passive dash, you can gain an advantage in trades by quickly applying silence followed by E for damage. After level 6, be cautious of Anvessa's R suppression, and while maintaining durability with W, it is important to check vision before approaching. In team fights, pay attention to Anvessa's approach to the backline, and by using silence to stop her initiation, you can safely handle her in coordination with your teammates.",
      "ポッピー": "Poppy has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy can block Anvessa's dash with her W, limiting Anvessa's mobility. Additionally, by using Poppy's E to pin Anvessa against a wall, she can aim for a stun, gaining an edge in one-on-one combat. Furthermore, Poppy has a wealth of crowd control (CC) and excels at peeling for her allies in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to focus on positioning with minions at the start of the lane and bait Anvessa's skills to counterattack. After level 3, create a line to pin Anvessa against a wall with E while trading by blocking her dash with W. After level 6, it is necessary to adjust your position in response to Anvessa's R and coordinate with your teammates to avoid being suppressed. In terms of item build, against AD, choosing Thornmail or armor boots increases durability, allowing for more stable combat. In team fights, it is crucial to control Anvessa with CC and protect your ADC.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen excels at long-range trades, using his E to block Anvessa's advance while dealing damage with his Q to clear minions. Additionally, Shen's W shield increases his durability by mitigating Anvessa's burst damage. Furthermore, Shen's R can support allies from an infinite range, making a significant impact in team fights.\n\nTo maintain the advantage, it's important to poke with Q while keeping distance from the minions in the early game and aim for last hits with E. By securing vision, reducing damage with W, and using Ult to roam or support allies, you can push the lane in your favor. Also, managing distance by utilizing Anvessa's dash and avoiding unnecessary engages will allow for a stable lane progression.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has strong burst damage in short trades, and she can take advantage of the timing when Anvessa's skills are on cooldown. With a combo using Irelia's Q, she can deal damage while utilizing the stun effect from her W to incapacitate Anvessa. Additionally, Irelia has a blink ability, making it easier to dodge Anvessa's attacks and giving her an edge in sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to prioritize CS in the early lane phase, using Q to last-hit minions and build up resets. During Anvessa's W shield, refrain from attacking, and when E misses, deal small damage with a short combo of Q → auto-attack → Q. In the mid-game, initiate trades when Anvessa's W shield is on cooldown, managing the wave to push Anvessa deep, making it harder for her to trigger her R. After level 6, while being mindful of positioning in team fights, aim to suppress her with E before she can use R, allowing for a favorable engagement if you can disrupt her before she can retaliate.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has high sustained damage and can use slows and immobilizations to limit the movement of the enemy, particularly in close combat, which can suppress Anvessa's mobility. Additionally, Singed excels at proxy farming, allowing him to apply pressure on Anvessa by pushing the minions. Furthermore, Singed can use his R (Poison) to make it difficult for Anvessa to approach.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, use Poison Trail to push the minions while proxy farming, staying at a distance where Anvessa's Q and E cannot hit you. Save your Fling and be mindful of the shield duration of your W, countering when Anvessa engages. In the mid-game and beyond, it is important to secure vision while applying pressure in the side lanes, and in team fights, creating chaos with split pushes or Fling against the backline is crucial. For Anvessa's R, save your Flash and avoid forcing a Fling into a wall; it is important to check for follow-up after the suppression.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, as his Q stacks allow his damage to scale infinitely. Although he is weak in the early game, if you farm properly and stack your Q, his strength becomes prominent in the mid to late game. Additionally, the slow effect from his W can limit the mobility of the enemy champion, allowing you to gain an advantage in close combat.\n\nTo take advantage, start by choosing Doran's Shield and farm safely. In the early stages of laning, avoid risky trades and focus on farming minions with your Q. During the laning phase, play the wave towards your tower and use your E to clear under the tower or avoid trades. Against the enemy's dash, use your W to root them, and around level 6, be cautious of their ultimate while securing vision and coordinating with your jungler.\n\nIn the mid to late game, focus on not dying while continuing to stack your Q, and prioritize survival in team fights while dealing continuous damage with your Q. For physical damage mitigation, prioritize purchasing armor items to maximize Nasus's strength.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum is strong in melee trades, and by using his W to close the gap while incorporating auto-attacks, he can negate the passive charge of Anubis while securing healing in skirmishes with minions. Additionally, Braum has skills that deal high damage with low cooldowns, making it easier to gain an advantage in early fights. Furthermore, by using Braum's CC skill, the stun, he can limit Anubis's movements and create more opportunities for attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (levels 1-3), actively initiate trades using W and Q while safely farming behind minions as a shield. In the mid-lane phase (around level 6), it is important to be cautious of Anubis's R while utilizing the shield from W to maintain durability and avoid Anubis's attacks using minions. From mid-game into team fights, it is essential to engage at the front line, use CC to restrict Anubis's movements, and coordinate with teammates to create advantageous situations.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has high sustain in close combat and can limit Anvessa's mobility with his E, which helps suppress her mobility. Additionally, Darius's W provides durability, and his R has strong kill confirmation potential against opponents. While Anvessa has a short-range dash, Darius can easily negate that dash with his E, making it difficult for her to counter his sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, first, manage your health with W in the early lane phase and prepare for short trades. It’s important to pull Anvessa in with E the moment she uses her skills, and to spam Q to stack your passive. Be mindful of the minion situation and avoid unnecessary aggression, while also making sure to force Anvessa to use her R and passive. Once you have 5 stacks, aim to finish with R, and utilize the timing of your ally jungler to create advantageous situations.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante possesses strong tank characteristics from early on, allowing him to exploit Anvessa's weakness until level 6. Anvessa has low damage output until level 6 and is particularly vulnerable to physical damage. K'Sante can effectively mitigate Anvessa's attacks by building armor and can further restrict her movements using crowd control skills.\n\nTo take advantage, K'Sante should actively use Q to deal damage in the early stages of lane combat, while utilizing W for shielding to maintain durability during trades. It is important to time attacks using the hitbox of W to avoid Anvessa's skills and engage with dashes. Additionally, to gain an early lead, K'Sante should pressure Anvessa to deplete her mana, ensuring she has no opportunity to recover energy. As for items, building armor early can help reduce Anvessa's damage while securing lane dominance.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous can utilize its high HP regeneration and increased critical hit rate from Fury to demonstrate sustained combat ability. Additionally, with its ultimate, it becomes invulnerable for 5 seconds, making it very strong in one-on-one situations and tower dives. On the other hand, Ambessa has high mobility but lacks crowd control skills and has inferior burst mobility, often unable to withstand Tremendous's sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, safely farm while closing the distance with E and healing with Q. After level 6, it is important to conserve the ultimate and time the counterattack in response to Ambessa's ultimate. Furthermore, performing split pushes can draw the opponent's attention, applying pressure to the entire team. To avoid Ambessa's suppression ultimate, it is also crucial to manage distance effectively and control the triggers that increase damage taken using W.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled can apply pressure on the opponent from the early game by utilizing short-term combos, especially maintaining Skaarl easily between levels 1 and 3. By leveraging the stacks from Kled's W, he can increase his auto-attack damage and engage in favorable trades against Ambeza. Additionally, Kled has high single-target damage and excels in one-on-one and small skirmishes, allowing him to finish the fight early before Ambeza can charge his passive.\n\nTo take advantage, first, use short combos (Q → AA → W stack) between levels 1 and 3 to deal damage while maintaining Skaarl. It is important to position yourself while dodging the opponent's skills with E and apply pressure in the bushes without overcommitting. After level 3, aim for the peak of W while being cautious of Ambeza's W deployment and passive charge, and look to secure short engagements. By chasing during jungle timings, you can apply further pressure on the opponent.\n\nIn the mid-game and beyond, Kled can utilize his R to deal with isolated enemies and prevent them from escaping or pursuing, allowing him to maintain an advantage in team fights. Overall, Kled's strength from early to mid-game is crucial in progressing the match favorably before Ambeza can grow."

      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Rumble's sustained area damage and heat management characteristics. Rumble has no skill cost and a short cooldown, allowing him to frequently use his skills to pressure Malphite. Additionally, Rumble's Q harassment and E zoning are effective, making it difficult for Malphite to approach. Furthermore, Malphite's hard CC is only his R, and positioning to avoid Rumble's ultimate is crucial, but he often cannot withstand Rumble's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to build armor items early (such as Frostfire Gauntlet or Sunfire) to reduce Rumble's damage. During the laning phase, applying slow with Q and then counterattacking with W and auto-attacks can be effective for short trades. Additionally, being mindful of heat management and positioning to avoid Rumble's skills can help reduce the risk of taking damage. Finally, in team fights, ensuring that R connects with allies can create opportunities to suppress Rumble's sustained damage.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble is strong against harassment from the early game and can easily deal damage to Braum using his Q for ranged attacks. Rumble has no skill cost and a short cooldown, allowing him to continuously attack. Additionally, Braum's main skills have a short range, making it difficult for him to approach, which makes him susceptible to Rumble's attacks. Furthermore, Rumble's ultimate (R) has high crowd control in team fights, making it very troublesome for Braum when he tries to all-in.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane, hide behind minions and position yourself to avoid Rumble's Q. This reduces the risk of taking harassment.\n2. Utilize the shield from E to reduce damage when taking hits from Rumble. It is especially important to time your counterattack after Rumble has used his skills.\n3. Once you reach level 6, use your ultimate (R) to aim for a quick finish. By attacking when Rumble's skills are on cooldown, you can gain an advantage.\n4. Having Flash as a summoner spell ensures you have an escape option, allowing you to avoid all-ins.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Rumble has high damage output and sustained poke ability, especially being able to deal damage before Ornn can close the gap. If Rumble manages his heat well, it becomes difficult for Ornn to avoid trading while overheated, making him susceptible to Rumble's skills. Additionally, Ornn has low mobility, making it hard for him to escape due to Rumble's slow effects. Furthermore, Ornn's CC skills require preparation, making it challenging to activate them effectively before taking damage from Rumble.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:  \n1. **Temperature Management**: It is important to aim for Rumble's overheated state and time your counterattacks after he uses his skills.  \n2. **Item Selection**: Purchasing armor and magic resistance items early to increase durability can help reduce Rumble's damage.  \n3. **Lane Strategy**: Try to position safely behind minions to avoid Rumble's skills, preventing unnecessary damage.  \n4. **Role in Team Fights**: In team fights, using Ornn's R to immobilize Rumble and coordinating with allies' CC can help turn the tide in your favor.  \n5. **Saving Flash**: It is crucial to save Flash before taking Rumble's R, preparing to escape at the right moment.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Ornn's disadvantages and create a more favorable situation.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has powerful area damage in close range, especially when overheated, which allows him to deal high damage. Teemo has a short range and is weak to all-ins, making him susceptible to Rumble's attacks. Additionally, when Rumble approaches with his E, Teemo is likely to miss the timing to apply his blind, increasing the risk of taking sustained damage. Furthermore, Rumble has high crowd control in team fights, making it difficult for Teemo to fight safely.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, maintain distance, harass with E, and be careful not to enter Rumble's Q range.\n2. When Rumble approaches with his E, immediately use Q to apply blind and neutralize his auto-attacks.\n3. Between levels 3 and 6, Rumble's damage is high, so avoid unnecessary fights and look for the timing of his overheating.\n4. Place mushrooms around the brush and on the enemy's return route to secure vision while using them to avoid ultimates or prevent chasing.\n5. Focus on side pushing and support team fights from a safe distance with poison and mushrooms to reduce risk.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Teemo's disadvantages and create a more favorable situation.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble's damage output from early to mid-game is very high, which can hinder Bloodmire's growth. Rumble can deal sustained damage with his Q while gaining a shield and increasing mobility with his W, making it difficult for Bloodmire to engage in skill trades. Additionally, Rumble's R (Flame Spitter) has a strong presence in team fights, and if Bloodmire mispositions, he can take significant damage. Furthermore, Bloodmire has low DPS in the early game, making him vulnerable to Rumble's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize minions in the early game to safely secure CS and avoid skill trades. Using W (Invulnerability) to dodge Rumble's skills and healing with Q can help maintain durability. After level 6, when looking to engage with R, it is necessary to be cautious of Rumble's R (Flame Spitter) and position accordingly. In terms of item purchases, starting with Doran's Shield can help secure health recovery, and if delayed, purchasing magic resistance items early (e.g., Hextech → Zhonya) can reduce Rumble's damage and increase survival rate in lane.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Rumble's high sustained damage and team fight capability. Rumble can use his skills frequently, making Fiora susceptible to harassment before she can engage, especially before level 6 when Rumble's damage is high, and Fiora can easily be killed. Additionally, Rumble's E slow effect and his ultimate, Equalizer, restrict Fiora's mobility, making it difficult for her to escape. Furthermore, Fiora lacks AoE attacks, resulting in slow wave clear and making it hard to gain control against Rumble.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, engaging after Rumble uses his Q can force him to waste his skills. Also, hiding behind minions to avoid Rumble's E can reduce damage taken. Once Fiora reaches level 6, she can look for an all-in after Rumble uses his Q, so timing her attacks is crucial. Additionally, purchasing Hexdrinker or Vampiric Scepter early can enhance Fiora's sustain and improve her survivability. Finally, using Riposte when Rumble overheats can block auto-attacks, reducing damage taken.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble is a high-damage melee mage who manages heat effectively, and he has strong crowd control, especially in team fights and tight spaces. Garen excels in close combat, but Rumble's sustained damage and slow effect from his Flamespitter make it difficult for Garen to find openings to attack. Additionally, while Rumble has limited escape skills, he can still maneuver advantageously against Garen's high mobility, but Garen struggles to withstand Rumble's continuous damage despite having silence.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use the E skill to dodge Rumble's Flamespitter and reduce damage. Purchasing items that provide magic resistance for 900 gold can also be effective. Choosing Doran's Blade or Second Wind can help Garen gain an advantage in sustained trades. Furthermore, utilizing Predator to quickly close the distance and combining Q, E, and R to attack can create opportunities to gain the upper hand against Rumble. By being mindful of early game positioning and reaching Stridebreaker, Garen can gain the confidence to fight at full strength.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble is a melee mage who can deal high damage using his skills, and he has strong crowd control and zoning power, especially in team fights and tight spaces. Jax has low base health and defense in the early game and is highly dependent on items, making him susceptible to damage when facing Rumble early on. Additionally, if Rumble manages his heat well, he can deal sustained damage, making it difficult for Jax to trade effectively. Furthermore, Jax has no ranged attacks, making him vulnerable to Rumble's harassment.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming and gather 1-2 items first. Buying a Negatron Cloak early and trading after Rumble uses his W can be effective. Also, using Jax's E in sync with Rumble's passive can create trading opportunities. In the early game, since Jax lacks agency, it is recommended to attack after Rumble uses his Q or W. Ultimately, after acquiring key items like Trinity Force, Jax should be able to win one-on-one encounters.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Rumble's continuous damage output, shields, and strength in close combat. Rumble can frequently use his skills while managing his heat, and his Q's burn damage is particularly powerful. Kennen excels at poking from a distance, but when he gets close to Rumble's Q, he is susceptible to damage, and if Rumble uses his W shield, trades become unfavorable for Kennen. Additionally, Rumble's ultimate has a high ability to control areas, allowing him to effectively coordinate with Kennen's ultimate in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, maintain distance while harassing with Q and be careful not to get close to Rumble's Q. Manage the wave and aim for roams without pushing too hard, which can influence other lanes. Also, after level 6, it is important to use the ultimate to deal instant damage and look for opportunities to stun. In terms of item selection, prioritizing Nashor's Tooth and Zhonya's Hourglass to increase durability can also be effective in improving survivability.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has sustained damage from a distance, and his harassment with Q is particularly strong. Rumble's E slow effect makes it difficult for Warwick to close the gap, hindering his ability to catch Rumble with his R. Additionally, Rumble has excellent crowd control in team fights and excels in narrow spaces, making it hard for Warwick to gain an advantage. Furthermore, Warwick has limited escape skills, making it challenging to withstand Rumble's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid pushing the lane too much and to be wary of Rumble's ganks. Properly placing wards and securing vision will make it easier to track Rumble's movements. Also, using Warwick's E to reduce incoming damage while leveraging Q for healing can be effective in prolonged fights. In team fights, it is necessary to position oneself carefully to avoid Rumble's R and coordinate attacks with allies.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Rumble's sustained magic damage from range and high burst potential. K'Sante is a melee tank with a short range, making it difficult to avoid Rumble's skills, especially the harassment from his Q and E. Additionally, if Rumble manages his heat well, he can deal continuous damage, potentially inflicting significant damage before K'Sante can close the gap. Furthermore, while K'Sante excels in one-on-one situations when all-out, Rumble's ultimate provides zoning and slow effects, making it challenging for K'Sante to approach.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early game, prioritize farming and focus on avoiding Rumble's skills rather than forcing engagements.\n2. Look for opportunities to engage in short trades when Rumble's main skills are on cooldown to secure favorable trades.\n3. Build magic resistance items early, and especially after level 6, use your ultimate to endure while looking for counterattack opportunities.\n4. Consider the threat from the jungle and work with your teammates to ensure favorable team fights.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble's sustained magic damage and area attacks can deal significant damage before Darius can close the gap. Rumble can frequently use his skills while managing his Heat, making Darius vulnerable to attacks from Q and E when he tries to approach with E. Additionally, Rumble's R can block Darius's engage path, making it difficult for Darius to create advantageous situations. Furthermore, Darius has low mobility, and Rumble's slow effects make it hard for him to escape.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid Rumble's attacks behind minions in the early game. Saving E and engaging with a short combo (E→Q→AA→W) when Rumble's Heat is low can be effective. It is also crucial to purchase magic resistance items (such as Mercury's Treads, Black Cleaver, and Sterak's Gage) early to increase durability against magic damage. After level 6, Darius can leverage his strengths by avoiding Rumble's R and looking for flanking opportunities.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has powerful ranged damage from the early game, and especially with his E, he can deal sustained damage and apply slow effects that limit Nasus's movement. Nasus is very weak in the early game and is susceptible to Rumble's attacks while trying to farm minions to stack his Q. Additionally, Rumble has no skill costs and can use his abilities frequently, allowing for continuous harassment against Nasus. Furthermore, Nasus only has a slow as a means of approach and has low mobility, making it difficult to avoid Rumble's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to start the first wave by pulling it to the tower and to avoid pushing too hard. When farming minions to stack Q, be cautious of getting burned by Rumble's E and look for opportunities to retaliate with AA→Q after closing the distance. Building items like Iceborn Gauntlet or Frozen Heart can be effective, considering magic resistance and attack speed reduction while prioritizing HP management. Additionally, if you find yourself in a disadvantageous situation due to the enemy's ultimate or Flame Spike, it is crucial to hide in the side bush to conserve your teleport and aim to return at the right moment.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has strong zoning capabilities from the early game and can pressure Singed while dealing sustained damage with his Q. In particular, Rumble's E slow effect restricts Singed's movement, making it difficult for him to engage. Additionally, Rumble's R is very powerful in team fights and proxy strategies, making Singed susceptible to damage before he can leverage his durability. Furthermore, Singed lacks long-range attack options, making it hard to avoid Rumble's attacks, especially in early trades where he is likely to fall behind.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary engagements between levels 1 and 3, farming behind minions with Q while utilizing potions and shields to survive. After level 3, you should harass Rumble with E while looking for opportunities to deal damage with Q. Additionally, proxy farming allows you to farm safely under the enemy tower, earning experience and gold. Moreover, in roams and team fights, using fling to draw out the enemy carry can be effective, making it easier for your backline to deal damage.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Rumble's sustained damage and area control capabilities. Rumble can frequently use his skills while managing his heat, and his harassment with Q and E is particularly strong. Additionally, Rumble's ultimate deals sustained damage and slows enemies within its range, making it difficult for Urgot to approach. While Urgot has a powerful short-range combo (E→Q→W→R), Rumble's skills often hinder that approach. Furthermore, Urgot has low escape potential and is vulnerable to Rumble's slows and sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, in the early lane phase, stand to the side to avoid Rumble's Q and save E for countering. You can aim for a short-term engagement by approaching after Rumble has overheated. It's also important to use minions as a shield to capitalize on Rumble's kill potential with R. As for items, prioritizing Black Cleaver is effective for increasing durability while boosting damage. Securing vision and managing minion waves are also key for Urgot to play favorably."

    "loses": {
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas can initiate short trades using his ranged Q and E, while continuously harassing with W to reduce magic damage. Additionally, Gragas's R can separate enemies, effectively neutralizing Rumble's sustained damage output. Rumble has difficulty managing his Overheat, and Gragas can take advantage of this by engaging when Rumble is in that state.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, position the wave in the middle lane closer to your side to make it easier to avoid Rumble's sustained damage. Between levels 1 and 2, chip away at Rumble with Q while conserving W to absorb his approach. When Rumble is using Q, avoid staying in front for too long and close the distance with E to aim for a short burst with Q → W → E. After level 6, while being cautious of Rumble's R, use Gragas's R to push back or knock away the opponent to create a favorable situation. Always be aware of Rumble's sustained damage line and focus on outmatching him with burst damage, as this is the key to victory.",
      "ライズ": "Ryze has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has high DPS and can effectively deal damage to Rumble by utilizing a skill combo with guaranteed CC (E→Q). Additionally, managing Rumble's heat is difficult, so by aiming to attack when he is overheated, it is possible to suppress Rumble's damage output. Furthermore, Ryze has the trait of increasing skill damage by consuming mana, making it easier to deal sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on CS in the early game while positioning to avoid Rumble's Flamespitter. By using E to approach while hiding behind minions and dealing damage with Q, you can gain an advantage in short trades. After level 6, utilize teleport and mid roam to time collective fights or side pressure. In particular, after forcing Rumble to use his ultimate (Equalizer), Ryze can actively engage to limit the opponent's movements and create a favorable situation.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes Ranged after level 6, allowing for sustained harassment and trading. Rumble's Q has a long range, but Kail can maintain distance while attacking by using her E. Additionally, Kail has an R that creates an invulnerable state, allowing her to avoid Rumble's Ult and gain an advantage in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first enter the lane with a Doran's Shield to better withstand Rumble's harassment. Play cautiously until level 6, aiming for short trades when Rumble's Q is on cooldown. It's important to rush buying a Stinger and progress to Wit's End to reduce Rumble's magic resistance while gaining some for yourself. Also, standing behind minions to block harpoons and being mindful of the number of minions during trades can create a more favorable situation. If Rumble uses his Ult, it's crucial to create distance with W and prepare for a counterattack.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce excels at harassing from a distance, and his Q poke is particularly powerful. Rumble has sustained damage in close range, but in the early game, it is difficult for him to counter Jayce's range, allowing Jayce to attack while maintaining distance. Additionally, Jayce can use his E to accelerate and quickly create distance, making it easier to avoid Rumble's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, use Q to chip away at Rumble's health in the early lane phase, actively harassing him while hiding behind minions to endure. After level 3, you can use E to accelerate and initiate trades in close range. It is especially important to establish an advantage before reaching level 6, pushing the tower while considering side roam to influence other lanes. By being cautious of Rumble's ultimate and maintaining distance while fighting, you can maximize Jayce's strengths.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has powerful percentage damage against tank champions and can effectively deal damage to melee mages like Rumble as well. Additionally, Gwen's high impact from her R (ultimate) and the ability to avoid enemy attacks with her Hallowed Mist give her high survivability in team fights and trades. Furthermore, managing Rumble's heat can be challenging, so there is a chance to take him down in one hit when he overheats.\n\nTo take advantage, first stack your Q for trades at level 1, and if you start with E, farm until level 2 to create a situation where you can win trades. After level 3, Rumble may overheat, so avoid E-Q while waiting for the wave to be pushed. After level 6, it's important to use your TP to shop and aim for an all-in. Also, make sure to never stand in Rumble's ultimate (Equalizer) and use Gwen's R to avoid damage while attacking, which can help you gain the upper hand. If you survive the early levels, you can continue to farm and become strong in the late game, so it's important to play patiently.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high mobility and sustain, allowing her to fight while avoiding Rumble's attacks. In particular, by dodging Rumble's ultimate (R), she can significantly reduce damage and make it easier to induce Rumble's overheat by managing his heat. Additionally, by utilizing Irelia's skill with a stun effect (E), she can neutralize Rumble's skills and create opportunities for counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be cautious of Rumble's high damage in the early game while focusing on good wave management. Using dashes to create distance is effective for avoiding Rumble's red Q. After level 3, Rumble becomes dangerous, so playing carefully and attacking when Rumble's heat is high can induce overheat and allow for favorable trades.\n\nAs for the item build, starting with Blade of the Ruined King and having Doran's Shield and Second Wind can enhance sustain. This makes it easier to gain an advantage in trades against Rumble. In team fights, it is crucial to avoid Rumble's ultimate while leveraging Irelia's high DPS to target the backline.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses high mobility and DPS, allowing him to maneuver advantageously against Rumble's area attacks, especially in the early lane phase. Rumble has strong sustained damage capabilities, but Yone can use his E to avoid the flames and also farm CS using minions with his Q. Furthermore, after reaching level 6, Yone can unleash powerful combos against Rumble with his R, making it easier to secure kills, especially by looking for flanks in the side lanes.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on prioritizing CS behind the minions in the early game while harassing Rumble by dodging his attacks with E. Once you reach level 6, actively engage Rumble using your R and aim for short combos (E→AA→Q→R) to deal damage. Additionally, purchasing magic resist boots and lifesteal will enhance your survivability, allowing you to avoid prolonged frontline fights while being mindful of flanking opportunities in the side lanes. This way, you can suppress Rumble's strengths while leveraging your own.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo can block Rumble's skills with Wind Wall, making it easier to negate Rumble's ranged attacks and skill shots. Additionally, by using Yasuo's E to approach while stepping on minions, he can avoid Rumble's attacks while effectively dealing damage. Furthermore, all of Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, allowing for sustained attacks, especially when there is an opportunity to counterattack right after Rumble has used all his skills.\n\nTo take advantage, first focus on maintaining the lane and use turret freezing to make it harder to take damage from Rumble's Q (Flamespitter). Next, look for openings after Rumble uses his skills and initiate an attack with the E→Q→R combo. Also, consider magic resistance as an item choice, purchasing Mercury's Treads and magic armor to better counter Rumble's sustained damage. Additionally, by strategically placing minions, you can create a path for Yasuo's E, making it easier to coordinate ganks and gain an advantage.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Tryndamere can use his ultimate to become invincible for 5 seconds, which allows him to negate Rumble's high-damage skills. Additionally, Tryndamere has a high HP regeneration ability, enabling him to excel in prolonged fights. Furthermore, since Tryndamere fights primarily with auto-attacks, he has a certain level of resistance against Rumble's skills.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important not to engage recklessly but to prioritize CS while utilizing sustain. To avoid harassment from Rumble's Q and E, it is crucial to hide behind minions to dodge poke. Once you reach level 6, use your ultimate to be cautious of Rumble's approach while looking for an all-in opportunity. After confirming Rumble's Flash and Zhonya, it is advisable to engage when you can secure a kill.\n\nMoreover, in the mid-game and beyond, you can utilize Tryndamere's strengths by split-pushing in the side lanes and seeking 1v1s while avoiding Rumble's ultimate area. In team fights, you can contribute to your team by avoiding Rumble's ultimate and using your R to endure while engaging in crowd control.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has powerful crowd control against Rumble, particularly with his W (Silence), which can prevent Rumble from casting his skills. Rumble's heat management is crucial, and when he overheats, he cannot take aggressive actions, allowing Cho'Gath to exploit that window. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration, enabling him to trade effectively over time.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first prepare your Teleport and Flash at the start of the lane, and enter the lane with a Doran's Shield or Corrupting Potion. Between levels 1 and 5, be cautious of Rumble's Q range while farming with E from behind the minions, looking for opportunities to counterattack. When Rumble overheats, attack with Q→W→AA and use W to interrupt Rumble's skills.\n\nAfter level 6, it is important to move sideways to avoid Rumble's ultimate (Equalizer) and regroup with allies before advancing. If Rumble tries to zone you aggressively, counterattack with Flash Q and aim for a guaranteed kill with R (Feast). In team fights, play as a tank on the front line while threatening the enemy carry with Q→R, and be mindful of Rumble's EQ combo as you maneuver.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has a wide range of hard crowd control and can deal high damage through consecutive attacks, making him particularly strong against opponents with low burst mobility. Rumble can unleash high damage using his skills, but Aatrox has a healing effect from his passive, allowing him to gain an advantage in sustained trades. Additionally, Aatrox's skills are easier to land on Rumble, who has long animations, enabling Aatrox to gain an upper hand in trades, especially from early to mid-game.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (levels 1-5), be cautious of Rumble's Q and W harassment while using Aatrox's Q to dodge Rumble's skills and look for counterattacks. In the mid-game (levels 6-11), utilize Aatrox's R to avoid Rumble's skills while initiating attacks, creating even more favorable situations. Furthermore, prioritize purchasing items like \"Spear of Shojin\" and \"Eclipse\" to enhance damage while focusing on dodging Rumble's skills.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser deals magic damage with all of his skills and has a strong trait for long trades. Rumble struggles with managing his heat gauge, and when he overheats, he gets silenced, making him vulnerable to Mordekaiser's sustained damage. Additionally, Mordekaiser's passive provides continuous damage and shields, allowing him to trade favorably. Furthermore, by using Mordekaiser's R, he can trap Rumble in the afterlife and create a one-on-one situation, making it very advantageous to fight.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to hit Q while farming and occasionally use W to trade. By avoiding Rumble's skills and closing in with E, you can force a one-on-one situation after making him use his skills by using R, leading to victory. Also, using your R after Rumble's ultimate can suppress his damage while dealing sustained damage. It is crucial to play confidently and read the opponent's movements while fighting.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon is strong in early short skirmishes and can gain an edge over Rumble in short trades. Pantheon's Q can attack over minions, allowing him to aggressively engage when Rumble's heat is low. Additionally, Pantheon has a leap and a stun, enabling him to deal high burst damage during all-ins. This allows him to inflict significant damage when Rumble is unable to manage his heat or when he closes the distance.\n\nTo take advantage, actively engage in short combos between levels 1 and 5, using minions as a shield to chip away at Rumble's HP with Q. By diving in when Rumble's heat is low, you can deal damage before he can retaliate. After level 6, it's important to roam before team fights to influence other lanes and shift the game in your favor. Also, while being mindful of Rumble's R, focus on either pushing the minions or avoiding his R to maximize Pantheon's strengths.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and multiple crowd control skills, allowing him to trade effectively while avoiding Rumble's abilities. By using Sion's E, he can safely farm while dodging Rumble's flames, enabling him to gain an advantage in early farm. Additionally, after Rumble uses Overheat or W, Sion can charge his Q and engage, aiming to stun while dealing damage.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (1-3), while Rumble pushes, Sion should use E to farm safely. In the mid-game (3-6), as Rumble applies pressure with sustained damage, Sion should conserve W and charge Q to engage the moment Rumble becomes vulnerable. Post level 6, Sion can use R to engage from the side, while Rumble uses Equalizer to create space, allowing for coordinated attacks with allies, thus gaining an advantage in team fights. It's also important to time jungle interventions effectively."

    "beats": {
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick's skill range is short, making it difficult to approach against the harassment and short trades from Urgot's ranged attacks. Urgot's Q harassment is powerful, especially in the early lane phase, leading to significant damage taken by Warwick. Additionally, if caught by Urgot's E, it becomes challenging for Warwick to land his R for crowd control, making him more susceptible to damage from Urgot's R. Furthermore, Urgot's laning from levels 1 to 3 is very strong, putting Warwick in a disadvantageous position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early lane phase, avoid forcing fights and instead approach from behind minions or bushes to heal with Q. By dodging Urgot's Q from the side instead of taking it head-on, you can reduce damage. Between levels 3 and 5, it is crucial to be cautious of Urgot's passive and avoid short trades. After level 6, it is effective to wait for Urgot to use his E before using R for crowd control, timing your attacks with Q and auto-attacks. Additionally, in terms of items, choosing those that provide health regeneration and physical durability will make it easier to counter Urgot.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has ranged attacks and overwhelming poke ability in the laning phase. Urgot is very strong from levels 1 to 3, and since Singed can only deal damage by getting close, it is difficult to avoid Urgot's attacks. Additionally, if Urgot disrupts Singed's positioning with his E and hits him with auto-attacks using his W, Singed will lose HP quickly in the early game. Furthermore, Urgot's R is less effective if Singed's HP is not reduced beforehand, but Urgot can reliably aim for kills after level 6, making it a very tough situation for Singed.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to secure vision with minions at the start and to move through minions while avoiding Urgot's Q and W. Utilizing proxy farming can help avoid lane maintenance and allow for roaming to gain experience. Additionally, purchasing armor-oriented durability items (boots + HP/armor) early on and using R to gain an advantage in short trades can be effective. Furthermore, using Fling as a last-ditch effort and throwing Urgot under the tower to limit his range can help turn the fight in Singed's favor.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has range and excels at poking from a distance early on. Urgot can safely farm CS while using minions as a shield, making it easier to negate Braum's engage. Additionally, Urgot's CC skills increase the likelihood of Braum getting stunned when trying to close the gap, making it easier for Urgot to gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, Urgot's laning phase from levels 1 to 3 is very strong, and if Braum tries to all-in recklessly, he risks taking damage in return.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to keep the following points in mind. First, look for opportunities to all-in after Urgot has used his main skills. By understanding Urgot's skill cooldowns and exploiting openings to attack, you can turn the tide in your favor. Additionally, strengthen coordination with the jungle to set up ganks on Urgot, reducing lane pressure. Finally, choosing a build that focuses on armor and increasing durability is crucial to lessen Urgot's damage and improve survival in lane.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot is very strong from level 1, especially with his E ability that pulls in enemies and deals high damage. If you can't avoid Urgot's E, you'll take significant damage and be at a disadvantage in trades. Additionally, Urgot becomes extremely powerful after level 13, making it difficult to secure kills in the side lane. Furthermore, Urgot's passive provides sustained damage and shields, complicating trades for Renekton. Without Fury, Renekton's combo damage decreases, making it harder to contest Urgot's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to let Urgot push the wave at level 1. You need to move carefully and time your trades to avoid Urgot's E. Buying a Doran's Shield first will help ensure sustain in lane. It's effective to engage when Urgot misses his E. Additionally, choosing items that focus on sustain (e.g., Sterak's Gage) can help you gain an advantage in the matchup against Urgot. In team fights, it's also crucial to avoid Urgot's attacks while supporting your team's damage carries.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that even though Urgot has a short range, his Q poke from a distance is powerful, making it easy for him to chip away at Kled during the early laning phase. Additionally, Urgot's E pull and stun are very troublesome, posing a significant risk when Kled tries to engage. Furthermore, Urgot has high durability, making it difficult for Kled to deal effective single-target damage. In particular, Urgot's R is a threat to Kled, and if Kled doesn't reduce Urgot's HP beforehand, he won't be able to respond effectively.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's crucial to manage the minion wave carefully and avoid Urgot's Q. Attempting short-term ambushes while mounted and provoking Urgot's E before engaging can help Kled trade more favorably. Additionally, luring in the allied jungler to create advantageous situations can also be effective. In terms of items, prioritizing Trinity Force and selecting armor that allows Kled to withstand Urgot's attacks is important. For runes, setting up for Conqueror or a more aggressive approach is advisable, and for summoner spells, choosing Flash and Ignite or Teleport depending on the situation would be beneficial.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot is very powerful in close combat, especially after level 6, where his ultimate can be a threat with its ability to capture and execute. Urgot has high base stats and percentage damage, allowing him to deal consistent damage to squishy carries like Quinn. Additionally, Urgot's skills have crowd control, making it easy for Quinn to be immobilized when he approaches, increasing the risk of taking damage in return. Furthermore, Quinn has weak AoE damage and limited impact in team fights, making it likely to remain in a disadvantageous situation against tank champions like Urgot.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Distance management in lane**: Be aware of Urgot's skill range and continue to poke him from a distance with Q to prevent his approach.\n2. **Utilizing E for disengagement**: When Urgot gets close, use E to quickly disengage and avoid taking damage.\n3. **Utilizing roams**: After level 6, use R to roam to other lanes, avoiding 1v1 situations with Urgot and impacting the map as a whole.\n4. **Item selection**: Purchase boots and health recovery items early to increase durability and better withstand Urgot's attacks.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot excels at close-range attacks, and his execution ability with his ultimate is particularly high, making it difficult for Nar to approach. In his mini form, Nar has low base stats and is weak to all-ins, making him susceptible to Urgot's attacks. Additionally, Urgot's CC skills make it hard for Nar to get close, and if he cannot manage the timing of transforming into his mega form well, he may end up in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Utilize poke in mini form to prevent Urgot from getting close.\n2. Be aware of Urgot's skill cooldowns and time your attacks after he uses his skills.\n3. When in mega form, coordinate with teammates for team fights and try to avoid Urgot's ultimate.\n4. Use wards to secure vision and track Urgot's movements, reducing the risk of being approached.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has ranged attacks and can maintain distance while attacking using his E and Q. Urgot has high base stats, and his laning is particularly strong from levels 1 to 3, allowing him to deal damage before Illaoi can get close. Additionally, Urgot's CC skills can reduce Illaoi's chances of landing her E (Test of Spirit). Furthermore, while Urgot's R has low damage, it can be ineffective if Illaoi hasn't reduced his HP beforehand, putting her at a disadvantage in that regard.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize collecting CS with Q from minions. Instead of forcing trades, it is effective to look for opportunities to land E after Urgot has used his E or Q. Additionally, during the cooldown of Urgot's E, engaging in short trades or pushing the tower can create opportunities to take control. Utilizing vision to set up ambushes is also effective. In terms of item selection, prioritizing Black Cleaver and durability items is crucial to reduce Urgot's damage.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has a very strong laning phase from levels 1 to 3, and can deal high damage, especially in one-on-one situations. If Jax gets caught by Urgot's E, it becomes difficult for him to escape, and it's hard to avoid the damage from Urgot's R. Additionally, Urgot has high durability as a tank, making it difficult for Jax to deal damage. Furthermore, Urgot's CC skills often neutralize Jax's attacks, and if he misjudges the timing to engage in team fights, he risks being taken down without being able to do anything.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Incorporate Warden's Mail into the build to reduce Urgot's damage.\n2. Actively attack before Urgot reaches level 9 to create an advantageous situation early on.\n3. Use Jax's E after Urgot uses his E to dodge the opponent's skills.\n4. Build HP to counter Urgot's R and increase durability.\n5. Play calmly and let minions attack to avoid Urgot's passive.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, Jax can alleviate his disadvantage against Urgot and progress the fight in a favorable manner.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot features a powerful all-in at close range and has the ability to close the distance with his E and aim for kills with his R after level 6. Teemo excels at harassing from a distance, but it becomes difficult to deal sustained damage against Urgot's durability and CC skills. Additionally, Urgot is very strong in the early levels from 1 to 3, making Teemo susceptible to counterattacks when he tries to harass. Furthermore, although Urgot's R has low damage, for Teemo, who becomes less effective if he doesn't reduce Urgot's HP beforehand, Urgot's durability poses a significant threat.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Teemo to manage the lane and harass from a distance using auto-attacks and E. He should avoid entering Urgot's attack range and be prepared to escape using Q. Additionally, placing mushrooms in brushes or along escape routes to secure vision and limit Urgot's movements can be effective. After level 6, it is crucial to block paths with his ultimate and maintain a position where he cannot be caught by Urgot. As for items, prioritizing Nashor's Tooth and then choosing Liandry's or on-hit items can help increase damage output.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot applies pressure with ranged attacks from the early game. Due to Urgot's E and W combo, Nasus is susceptible to damage and finds it difficult to farm. Additionally, Urgot has a very strong laning phase from levels 1 to 3, which can create an advantageous situation before Nasus can stack his Q. Furthermore, Urgot has crowd control skills that can hinder Nasus's approach, making him more likely to be at a disadvantage in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize safely farming and stacking Q without forcing attacks in the early game. Surviving with a Doran's Shield or cloth armor plus potions while avoiding Urgot's skills and farming with the minions is crucial. When the opponent pushes, resetting and stacking Q under the tower is advisable, and conversely, freezing when the opponent is away to set up for jungle ganks is a good strategy. After level 6, using Wither to reduce Urgot's movement and attack speed before attacking with Q can create advantageous situations, especially by engaging right after he uses important skills. Being aware of team coordination and aiming for kills in conjunction with ganks is also effective.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has high durability and excels in close combat, making it difficult for Kennen to harass or land stuns. If Kennen gets caught by Urgot's E (Flip), there is a risk of being instantly killed by Urgot's R. Additionally, Urgot's laning phase from levels 1 to 3 is very strong, making it hard for Kennen to maintain distance. Furthermore, Urgot's skill activation is slow, which can prevent Kennen from setting up his skills effectively.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid getting too close in the early lane phase and to harass with Q while attacking from behind minions. During Urgot's W activation, maintain distance and be mindful of the timing to use E to escape. After level 6, utilize the ultimate to aim for AoE stuns in team fights, and use Zhonya's at the right moment to increase survivability against Urgot's R. In terms of item build, it is also effective to prioritize magic resistance by purchasing MR items early to reduce Urgot's damage.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has high base stats and percentage damage, making his laning phase particularly strong from levels 1 to 3. When Irelia is pulled or stunned by Aatrox's E, her means of escape are limited, making her susceptible to damage. Additionally, Aatrox's R has a powerful execution ability against low-health opponents, making it dangerous for Irelia to approach when her health is low. Furthermore, Aatrox has high durability as a tank, which makes it difficult for Irelia to deal damage, diminishing her advantage in close fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid taking Aatrox's Q in the early lane and to use minions to earn resets on her Q. After level 3, Irelia can aim for a stun with her E after Aatrox uses his E, creating opportunities to counterattack with her Q or auto-attacks. In terms of item selection, prioritize armor penetration and offensive items to chip away at Aatrox's durability. In team fights, be mindful of the range of Aatrox's R and avoid diving in recklessly; instead, approach from the back to evade Aatrox's powerful skills.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that the high base stats and percentage damage of Urgot make it difficult for Camille to deal damage. In particular, Urgot can target isolated Camille with his R, and even if Camille saves her E or Flash, it becomes challenging to retaliate due to Urgot's CC and shield. Additionally, while Camille can use her W to time her counterattack when hit by Urgot's attacks, it is not easy to counter Urgot's attack power and durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to approach from the shadows of minions in the early game while avoiding Urgot's Q to farm. By using E to take advantage of corners and walls, Camille can deal short bursts of damage through surprise attacks. Furthermore, actively trading when Urgot's E misses or is on cooldown can create opportunities to gain an advantage. After level 6, when aiming for solo kills with R, it is essential to consider the CC from allies and the state of side waves to engage safely. Additionally, utilizing roams to extend advantages in other lanes can also be effective.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has ranged attacks and can exert high lane control from the early game. Urgot can harass with his Q and look for all-in opportunities while maintaining distance with his E. Furthermore, Urgot's skills deal percentage damage, allowing him to consistently deal damage to tank-built Malphite. Malphite is vulnerable to Urgot's attacks when he gets close, and it becomes particularly difficult to secure kills with Urgot's R after level 6.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forced auto-attack trades in the early game and prioritize CS. Harass with Q through minions and maneuver while reducing damage taken with E. Additionally, after level 6, it is crucial to not hold onto R and use it at a timing when it can definitely hit in team fights. In terms of items, building armor early can effectively increase durability and reduce Urgot's damage."

    "loses": {
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and multiple CC skills, allowing him to withstand attacks from Urgot. In particular, using Sion's Q after Urgot uses his E makes it easier to disrupt Urgot's attacks. Additionally, by maximizing Sion's W, he can increase his durability while farming CS, making it possible to trade favorably against Urgot.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively harass Urgot between levels 1 and 3 while prioritizing CS and increasing HP with W's passive. Hitting Q while Urgot's E is on cooldown allows you to deal damage while avoiding Urgot's attacks. Furthermore, using Sion's ultimate against Urgot's ultimate grants CC immunity, preventing you from being dragged. Additionally, equipping Bramble Vest can suppress Urgot's healing, allowing you to gain an advantage in fights. After level 9, as W is maximized, it is recommended to be aggressive before trading becomes difficult.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo can effectively utilize his high mobility and Wind Wall (W) against Urgot, allowing him to block Urgot's attacks while creating opportunities for counterattacks. Since Urgot's Q and R are projectiles, they can be mitigated by blocking them with W. Additionally, while being cautious of Urgot's E dash, Yasuo can time his counterattacks effectively.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, Yasuo should dash behind the minions and charge his Q for short trades. It's important to be aware of Urgot's skill cooldowns, conserve E, and use allies' crowd control or his own minion knock-up to land R. Once a health advantage is established, utilizing side lanes or roaming can effectively expand that lead. By avoiding Urgot's attacks and dealing sustained damage, Yasuo can secure victory.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn is a melee tank who can withstand and utilize his durability while taking damage from Urgot's attacks. Ornn's skills have crowd control, and his R's knock-up is particularly effective at limiting Urgot's movements. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane maintenance, and he has high HP regeneration. This allows him to continuously fight while taking damage from Urgot.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to be cautious of Urgot's Q and E in the early game while farming behind the minions. The moment Urgot misses his E, counterattack with Ornn's Q→W combo and chip away at his health with short auto-attacks and skill cycles. Especially, approaching and attacking while Urgot's E is on cooldown can give you an edge in damage trades. After level 6, pay attention to the range and angle of Urgot's R, and by coordinating with your jungle, you can leverage Ornn's R to gain an advantage in team fights.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick needs to engage in melee attacks against Urgot, making it easier to avoid Urgot's long range and crowd control. Yorick can use his E (Morning Mist) to summon a ghost and trade in mini skirmishes while healing with his Q. Additionally, after level 6, he can overwhelm Urgot with sheer numbers by using the Maiden. Urgot's R is dangerous if he gets out of range, but Yorick can easily use walls to limit Urgot's movement and gain an advantage in fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, avoid unnecessary trades and be careful not to get poked by Urgot's Q or ranged auto-attacks. Land your E to summon the ghost and trade while healing with Q. Follow up immediately when you catch him with W's cage, and after level 6, mark him with E→Q, bind him with W, and attack with the Maiden and the ghost. Additionally, you can create further advantages by calling in the jungle when Urgot misses his E. It is recommended to take Teleport and Ignite as summoner spells, and it is important to apply kill pressure while being able to return to lane.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has sustained magic damage at close range, and his R provides high area control. Although Urgot excels at harassing from a distance, Rumble can use his E to immobilize the opponent and initiate short trades with his Q. Additionally, Rumble's W shield helps him gain an advantage in short trades. Urgot's skills have long cooldowns and are particularly reliant on levels, allowing Rumble to gain an upper hand against Urgot if played well.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (1-5), avoid Urgot's ranged attacks while closing in with E and initiate short trades with Q, aiming to overheat slightly. By hiding behind minions to land Q, you can deal damage to Urgot while avoiding unnecessary proximity. After level 6, be cautious of Urgot's R while creating a health advantage with the EQ combo or using R to establish an area that prevents Urgot's engage. It is crucial for Rumble to capitalize on moments when Urgot's W or passive is on cooldown. Additionally, focusing on HP and AP-oriented builds with items and runes will be key to balancing durability and damage against Urgot, leading to victory.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath is strong in close combat, and by silencing before taking damage from Urgot's attacks, he can disable Urgot's skills. While Urgot excels in short trades, Cho'Gath can close the distance with his Q and silence with his W, allowing him to negate Urgot's attacks while counterattacking. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration, enabling him to sustain fights even after taking damage from Urgot.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to stand behind minions in the early lane phase to block Urgot's Q with them. When Urgot closes the distance with his E, look for a chance to counterattack by approaching with your E and landing an auto-attack. After level 6, you can silence with Q→W, deal damage with auto-attacks and E, and aim for a secure kill with your R. It's also crucial to purchase armor items early to reduce Urgot's damage. In team fights, use Q to zone in the frontline and silence Urgot's key skills with W, which can help your team gain an advantage in the battle.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, allowing him to deal high burst damage while controlling Urgot's attacks. In particular, by avoiding Urgot's skills and harassing him with Gragas's Q (Barrel), it is possible to chip away at Urgot's resources. Additionally, using Gragas's E (Body Slam) and R (Explosive Cask) can disrupt Urgot's positioning and create opportunities to negate his R (Fear Beyond Death).\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, use minions to place Q (Barrel) while harassing Urgot from a distance. After Urgot uses his W or shield, engage in a short skirmish with E→W→Q, avoiding prolonged fights. Once you reach level 6, be mindful of Urgot's R, using your R to knock him back and separate him from allies or safely retreat yourself. In team fights, it is effective to use your R to pull Urgot away to protect your ADC or to dive in with R→E→W→Q for a quick burst.",
      "セト": "Set has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Set can leverage his early game strengths against Urgot, especially being able to trade while avoiding Urgot's attacks between levels 1 and 3. If Set can dodge Urgot's E, he can create a favorable fighting situation. Additionally, Set has sustained HP recovery and a strong shield, making him likely to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to first avoid Urgot's E. After forcing Urgot to use his E, using Set's W to aim for a stun or initiating an attack with the E→W combo is effective. Between levels 4 and 8, Urgot becomes weaker, so it is important to actively farm CS and overwhelm Urgot during this timing. Furthermore, if Urgot uses his E near the tower, Set can use his R to pull him towards the tower, creating an opportunity to take him down.\n\nUltimately, it is important to take him down early before Urgot becomes strong. If the team cannot deal with Urgot, he can deal significant damage on the front line, so establishing an advantage early is key to victory.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control (CC) and excels at avoiding Urgot's skills. Urgot's W (Flip) can be easily dodged, allowing K'Sante to evade Urgot's attacks and maintain an advantage in one-on-one situations. Additionally, K'Sante's all-out state significantly increases his damage, enabling him to launch powerful attacks against Urgot.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be aware of Urgot's skill cooldowns and to engage after he has used his skills. Specifically, attacking after Urgot has used both of his legs increases the chances of counterattacks. Also, when Urgot's E or R is in use, it's crucial not to use K'Sante's R and to keep track of Urgot's leg positions while moving. Prioritizing Warden's Ambush and equipping Tabis can reduce Urgot's damage, and in the late game, engaging in short trades and resetting Urgot's cleaver stacks can help turn the battle in your favor.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has a dash attached to all of his skills, making it easier to evade Urgot's attacks with his high mobility. He can avoid Urgot's poke from Q with his passive dash, and since he has a high short-term damage output, he can play favorably against Urgot. Additionally, Anbessa can close the distance against Urgot's long-range Q using his dash, making trades in the lane easier.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, safely clear minions using Q and E while avoiding Urgot's attacks and conserving his passive. After Urgot uses Q, use W to shield during the window of opportunity and retaliate with an empowered auto-attack. In the mid-game, it's important to utilize E's slow to close the distance and chip away at Urgot with consecutive attacks. In the late game, using R to dive into the backline or ranged carries and applying suppression can help gain an advantage in team fights. It's also important to avoid isolation while waiting for teammates to follow up.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has strength in the late game and high HP regeneration, allowing him to continuously fight while taking damage from Argoth. Particularly, when hit by Argoth's E, which pushes him against the wall, or the W combo, Tremendous can use his R to become temporarily invincible, avoiding the instant death judgment from Argoth's R. Additionally, by maneuvering outside the range of Argoth's E, Tremendous can avoid his attacks while healing with Q and engaging in mini trades.\n\nTo maintain the advantage, in the early game, maneuver outside the range of E, healing slightly with Q while engaging in mini trades. Be careful not to push the minion wave too much and avoid being baited by Argoth's E, ensuring that you don't get pushed against the wall. Upon reaching level 6, be aware of Argoth's R, use your own R to withstand damage, bait out the opponent's E, and then counterattack with a full combo. In this way, Tremendous can maintain an advantageous position against Argoth and aim for victory.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes stronger as she levels up, and especially after level 6, she can attack from range, dealing sustained damage to Urgot. Additionally, by using Kail's skill with a slow effect, she can hinder Urgot's approach and fight while maintaining distance. Furthermore, Kail has an ultimate that creates an invulnerable state, allowing her to avoid guaranteed kills from Urgot's ultimate.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid close combat between levels 1 and 5 and stabilize CS behind the minions. While avoiding Urgot's attacks, utilize healing items to maintain health. Once reaching level 6, it is crucial to apply pressure on Urgot using her ranged attacks while keeping distance. Upon reaching levels 11 and 16, maneuver to safely deal damage from the backline and contribute in team fights. For summoner spells, choosing Flash and Heal (or Teleport) allows for safer lane progression by relying on the allied jungle."

      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail is very weak in the early game, especially vulnerable to Gragas's attacks until she reaches level 6. Gragas has strong harassment with his auto-attacks, Q, and E, and an all-in at level 6 is particularly dangerous. Kail has low damage output as a melee champion until she hits level 6, making it difficult to counter Gragas's burst damage. Additionally, Gragas has crowd control, which makes it easier to limit Kail's movement and hard to maintain distance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize minions and farm safely in the early lane while avoiding Gragas's attacks. Using W to apply a slow and creating distance can help reduce harassment. Also, summoners should choose TP and Flash, and it is crucial to avoid overextending before level 6. For items, selecting attack speed or ability power from Nashor's and being mindful of scaling as levels increase is advisable.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the CC skills and AoE damage that Gragas possesses. Gragas has stuns and knockbacks, which can prevent Sett from closing the gap. Additionally, while Gragas's skills have a slow activation time, they hinder Sett's ability to deal sustained damage. Furthermore, Gragas has a long range and can harass from a distance, making it easy for Sett to take damage and lose lane dominance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, prioritizing objectives is crucial. Instead of directly confronting Gragas, targeting towers, dragons, and heralds can help leverage Sett's strengths. Additionally, performing split pushes in side lanes and utilizing the Demolish rune to quickly destroy towers can be effective. Furthermore, choosing Tenacity runes or Mercury's Treads can make it easier to counter Gragas's CC. Finally, in team fights, using Sett's R for counter-engagement or peeling is important to minimize Gragas's impact.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas's skills are very effective against Rumble. Gragas can engage with his E, deal damage with his W, and knock back enemies in the area with his R. This makes Rumble susceptible to Gragas's full combo, especially after level 6 when Gragas's pressure increases with his R. Additionally, Gragas has crowd control, making it difficult for Rumble to manage his heat and increasing the risk of overheating. Furthermore, Gragas is favored against champions that rely heavily on auto-attacks, putting Rumble at a disadvantage in that regard.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it's important to use Q to burn minions from the start, managing aggro while avoiding Gragas's skills. Particularly, after Gragas uses his E, you can create opportunities for counterattacks. Also, make sure to manage your heat properly to avoid overheating. After level 6, be cautious of Gragas's R, and it's crucial to secure vision and maintain distance. As for items, purchasing magic resistance items early can effectively reduce Gragas's damage. Finally, in team fights, it's important to position yourself to block Gragas's engage routes and focus on zoning in the frontline.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite cannot adequately counter Gragas's CC skills and burst damage. Gragas has the ability to harass with his Q barrel and close the distance with his E, making him particularly powerful after level 3. Additionally, Gragas's R has a high ability to disrupt enemy formations, making him a significant threat in team fights. While Malphite is primarily a tank strong against physical attacks, he often struggles to effectively deal with Gragas's AP damage and CC-immune skills.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Item Build**: Building MR items early can help reduce Gragas's AP damage. It is especially beneficial to choose items that provide barriers or shields.\n\n2. **Lane Play**: Maintain distance to avoid Gragas's Q, and try to move away before the barrel explodes when it is deployed. It is crucial to time your counterattack when Gragas has used his skills and is vulnerable.\n\n3. **Jungle Intervention**: Coordinate with your jungler to apply pressure on Gragas, which can help maintain lane dominance.\n\n4. **Role in Team Fights**: It is important to time Malphite's R to negate Gragas's R and other skills, aiming for an engage in team fights.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, you can mitigate Malphite's disadvantages and play more favorably.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has crowd control (CC), particularly with his E (Body Slam) for engaging and R (Explosive Cask) for knockback, which are powerful. Jayce excels at harassing while maintaining distance, but when Gragas closes in, it becomes difficult for him to leverage that strength. Additionally, Gragas can build tanky, making him durable in sustained trades, which reduces the effectiveness of Jayce's burst damage. Furthermore, after level 6, Gragas can execute a full combo (Cask → Body Slam → R) to engage quickly, making it hard for Jayce to avoid that attack.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Distance Management**: It's crucial to always maintain distance from Gragas and be prepared to escape using E (Acceleration Gate).\n2. **Minion Management**: Properly controlling the minion wave can create situations where Gragas finds it hard to approach, making it easier to harass.\n3. **Team Coordination**: Coordinating with the jungler or support can reduce risk by ensuring that help is available when Gragas engages.\n4. **Item Selection**: Being mindful of mana management early on and purchasing mana regeneration items as needed will allow for more frequent use of skills.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas is a champion with CC immunity, and when he uses his E, it negates Teemo's blind effect, making it easier for him to engage in long trades. Additionally, Gragas's Q and R can knock Teemo back, making him vulnerable to attacks when he gets close, which is particularly tough for Teemo in team fights due to his fragility. Furthermore, Gragas has high durability, making it difficult for Teemo's sustained poke to be effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to engage in short trades with Q through minions from the early game to reduce Gragas's auto-attacks. Additionally, you can poke while avoiding his E and maintain distance with W to dodge Gragas's attacks. Properly placing mushrooms to secure vision while being cautious of ganks and avoiding Gragas's skills is advisable. After level 6, be mindful of Gragas's R knockback and adjust your positioning to gain an advantage in team fights.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has ranged attacks and can easily poke Darius. Gragas can chip away at Darius's health with his barrel (Q) and deal damage before Darius can close the gap. Additionally, Gragas has a high ability to engage or disengage with his E, making it difficult for Darius to initiate long trades before using his E. Furthermore, Gragas's R can interrupt Darius's ultimate, allowing him to disrupt Darius before he can stack up.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to engage after forcing Gragas to use his E. When Gragas is poking with barrels, you should maintain distance as much as possible while using minions to farm CS. Also, being aware of Gragas's ultimate cooldown and timing your attacks accordingly can create opportunities to leverage Darius's strengths. Purchasing defensive items early to increase durability is also effective.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas is a very powerful champion in both lane and team fights, and he has the ability to deny Mordekaiser's engage. Gragas's Q (Barrel) slows and his W (Dash) provides damage reduction, while his E (Knockback) makes it difficult for Mordekaiser to approach. Additionally, Gragas's R (Ultimate) can interrupt Mordekaiser's R (Ultimate), making it hard for Mordekaiser to create one-on-one situations. Furthermore, Gragas excels in poke and sustain, allowing him to gain an advantage in long trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to avoid harassment in lane by dodging Gragas's skills while securing CS (last hits on minions). It is also effective to time your approach using E (Pull) when Gragas's skills are on cooldown. Additionally, in terms of item build, prioritizing items that increase durability can help reduce Gragas's damage and improve survival in lane. Finally, strengthening coordination with teammates and being mindful of team fights to counter Gragas is also crucial.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has skills that negate Olaf's strengths. Gragas's ultimate can scatter Olaf's attacks, and by knocking Olaf back with his E, he can create distance. Additionally, Gragas has plenty of AoE damage and crowd control, making it difficult for Olaf to approach. Furthermore, Gragas's skills can take the initiative against Olaf, who has slow ability activation, making Olaf more likely to be at a disadvantage in trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on avoiding Gragas's skills from the early game. By engaging after Gragas uses his E, you can create opportunities to negate his crowd control. Additionally, applying pressure on Gragas with jungle support can reduce his lane sustain. In terms of items, choosing a build that emphasizes health and penetration can effectively chip away at Gragas's durability.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas's CC skills and healing abilities are very effective against Pantheon's all-in strategy. Gragas can disrupt Pantheon's engage with his E and harass from a distance with his Q barrel. Additionally, Gragas's R can knock enemies back, breaking up Pantheon's attacks and increasing his impact in team fights. Furthermore, Gragas can build tanky, making it difficult for Pantheon to sustain in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to actively engage between levels 1 and 3, targeting moments when Gragas's skills are on cooldown. Also, while being cautious of Gragas's E and R, utilizing roams to side lanes to secure kills can help shift the overall flow of the game in your favor. Additionally, creatively building items to deal damage early on and continuously applying pressure on Gragas can also be effective.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas's CC skills and burst damage are very effective against Urgot. Gragas can close the distance with his E and control team fights while limiting Urgot's movements with his R. Additionally, Urgot has a short range, making it difficult for him to deal with Gragas's zoning from barrels (Q) and harassment from a distance. Furthermore, Urgot's R is less effective unless the opponent's HP is reduced beforehand, making it hard to deal sufficient damage against Gragas's durability and healing.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, engaging in close trades when Gragas's E is on cooldown can be effective. Additionally, blocking Gragas's barrels (Q) with minions can reduce harassment while creating opportunities for counterattacks. After level 6, it is crucial to wait for Gragas's CC to be used before activating R to ensure a kill, so timing is key. Furthermore, properly adjusting your build and purchasing defensive items early based on AP or AD threats is also important for increasing durability.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has strong long-range pressure with his Q, making it difficult for Riven to approach. Additionally, Gragas's W provides damage reduction and healing, which can easily offset Riven's burst damage, putting her at a disadvantage when trying to secure a quick kill. Furthermore, Gragas's E and R can be very effective for counterattacks, allowing him to deny or turn around Riven's engages. Riven is weak against immobilizing crowd control, so there is a risk of being unable to do anything if Gragas's skills land.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to watch for the landing of Gragas's Q and use E to shield, reducing damage while looking for counterattack opportunities. Additionally, being aware of Gragas's skill cooldowns, especially during the cooldown of W, allows for favorable trades by executing short combos. Freezing the lane and waiting for Gragas to overextend, while using minions to harass safely, can also be effective. Furthermore, being mindful of jungle interference and leveraging Riven's burst to secure early kills is key to achieving victory.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant area damage and crowd control, particularly with his E for knockback and his R for strong engage in team fights. Warwick is a melee champion, and when he takes damage from Gragas's skills, he is easily harassed, especially when Gragas's Q whittles down his health, making it difficult for Warwick to utilize his sustain. Additionally, Gragas can attack while maintaining distance from Warwick, who has low mobility, making it hard for Warwick to close the gap.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to place wards effectively to avoid harassment in lane and to keep track of Gragas's movements. Also, utilizing the cooldowns of Gragas's skills to time your attacks and avoid damage from his Q is crucial. Furthermore, as for item builds, purchasing defensive items early to reduce Gragas's damage is effective. Finally, while being cautious of Gragas's R, coordinating with teammates in team fights is essential to create opportunities to leverage Warwick's strengths."
    },
    "loses": {
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage and is a champion strong in short trades. Gragas has AoE damage and CC, but his skills have a slow activation time, especially the charge of his Q, which makes it easier for Camille to approach and attack. Additionally, by using Camille's E (Hookshot) to dodge Gragas's Q, she can attack without taking damage. Furthermore, by using Camille's R (Perfect Execution), she can isolate Gragas and ensure damage is dealt.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, manage minions and use the range of Q to harass. Between levels 3 and 5, it's important to gain a potion advantage through short bursts of damage and to avoid trades under the tower. After level 6, using R to isolate Gragas and apply immediate kill pressure is effective. Also, while being mindful of Gragas's healing and AoE, use W for shields to maintain sustain, and focus on avoiding damage in extended fights. In team fights, target squishy enemies and ensure isolation with R to maximize Camille's strengths.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn is a tank champion with high durability and excels at lane sustain. Gragas has AoE damage and crowd control, but Ornn can reduce damage with his W and retaliate in short trades. Additionally, Ornn can upgrade items as he levels up, making him a powerful presence in the late game. Gragas's skills have a slow activation time, especially the charge time of his Q, allowing Ornn to exploit those openings to attack.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to maintain distance with minions between levels 1 and 3 to avoid Gragas's Q barrel. By saving E and forcing Gragas to use his E first, Ornn can reduce damage with his W while counterattacking with Q. After level 6, while being cautious of Gragas's R, Ornn should use his own R to focus on positioning and lead enemies towards walls to create advantageous situations. In the mid-game, managing waves on the side and initiating team fights with R as a tank can prevent isolation from Gragas's R while contributing to the team.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has high sustained damage and is very durable against Gragas's skills. Gragas has crowd control, but Singed has high movement speed and can escape using slows and his fling. Additionally, Singed excels at proxy farming, making it easy to secure experience even if Gragas pushes the lane. Furthermore, Singed's poison deals continuous damage, which can negate Gragas's healing.\n\nTo take advantage, at the start of the lane, Singed should use Poison Trail to harass Gragas while maintaining distance. If Gragas tries to harass with his barrel, Singed can avoid it with his E without closing the distance and gain an experience lead through proxy farming. Since getting hit by Gragas's R can put Singed at a disadvantage, he should use his R to increase his durability and use his fling to throw enemies behind him, allowing him to perform well in team fights. It's also important to control the poison area while cutting vision, making it easier for allies in the backline to deal damage.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in lane. In particular, Gragas is a champion that relies heavily on auto-attacks, and by avoiding Gragas's attacks while poking with his Q skill, Gangplank can apply pressure on the opponent. Additionally, Gragas's skills have a slow cast time, especially the charge time of his Q, which allows Gangplank to take advantage of those openings to attack.\n\nTo gain the advantage, focus on farming in lane while avoiding Gragas's skills and harassing with your Q skill. When Gragas uses his barrels to attack, you can use your W skill to cleanse the CC while healing, allowing you to maintain your durability in fights. Furthermore, it is important to endure until the late game and ensure that you can deal powerful burst damage once your items are fully built. This will create a favorable situation against Gragas.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has a dash attached to all of his skills, making it easier to trade against Gragas by utilizing his high mobility. In particular, Gragas has a slow skill activation and takes time to charge his Q, allowing Anbessa to use his dash to avoid attacks or counterattack. Additionally, Gragas is favorable against champions that rely heavily on auto-attacks, and Anbessa can easily harass using his mobility.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to first deplete Gragas's mana. When Gragas uses his skills, you can engage with W, dealing damage while escaping. Also, by attacking when Gragas attempts to use his Q, you can force him to waste his skill. Furthermore, considering proxy farming, you can continue to apply pressure on Gragas by invading the enemy jungle or ganking mid. In team fights, leveraging dive potential can also effectively increase opportunities to eliminate enemies.",
      "ナー": "NAR has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that NAR has high mobility in mini form, and Gragas's skill activation is slow, making it easier for NAR to harass while avoiding Gragas's attacks. Additionally, NAR can utilize his crowd control (especially the stun during Mega NAR) to limit Gragas's movements, allowing for advantageous fights during all-ins. Furthermore, NAR's transformation improves his base stats, making it easier to withstand Gragas's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, NAR should actively harass in mini form while avoiding Gragas's skills to deal damage. It’s effective to create distance while Gragas is charging his Q, then use W or E to close the gap and engage in an all-in after Gragas has used his skills. Also, when transforming into Mega NAR, it’s important to use R to stun Gragas and create opportunities for additional damage. This way, NAR can create a favorable situation before taking any counterattacks from Gragas.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high durability and can secure kills easily by using his R. Additionally, his W silence can suppress Gragas's burst damage, making him strong in close trades. Gragas excels at harassing from a distance (with his barrel Q) to chip away at sustain, but Cho'Gath can negate Gragas's combos by silencing him with W before taking that harassment.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize securing minions in the early lane phase and avoid stepping on Gragas's barrels unnecessarily. Silence him with W just before he engages with E or during the casting of Q, and engage in short trades to gain an advantage. If the opponent misses E, initiate a long trade with Q (knock-up) → E + AA to deal damage. After level 6, use R to apply a slow and create opportunities for kills. After backing, prioritize purchasing durability items and return to lane in an even stronger state.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora can negate Gragas's CC with her W, making it difficult for her to be hit by Gragas's attacks. Additionally, Fiora deals true damage, allowing her to effectively damage a tank-built Gragas. Furthermore, Fiora can showcase her strength in one-on-one situations, giving her an edge in fights against Gragas.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on avoiding Gragas's Q while prioritizing CS in the early lane phase. It's important to wait for the moment when Gragas engages with his E, parry with W to negate the CC, and then counterattack. After level 6, you can gain an advantage by parrying Gragas's R with W. Also, by split-pushing and creating 1v1 situations, you can leverage Fiora's strengths. Being mindful of Gragas's R and potential interventions from allies, attacking at the right moment is key to victory.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and is characterized by a playstyle that consumes HP while fighting. Against Gragas's burst damage, Mundo can heal with his R while enduring the damage, allowing him to perform favorably, especially in team fights and long trades. Additionally, due to Mundo's passive, he can negate hard crowd control, giving him strong resistance against Gragas's CC skills.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, it is important to farm minions from a distance with Q while avoiding damage. It is effective to harass by dodging Gragas's barrels and using E to close the distance or create space. In the mid-game, purchase tank items, and when taking Gragas's burst, heal with R and look for a chance to counterattack. In team fights, it is advisable to take the lead as a tank, protecting allies while isolating Gragas.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has the ability to block Gragas's CC, especially by using his W to negate Gragas's E. This allows K'Sante to safely counterattack when Gragas comes in aggressively. Additionally, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in an all-out state, and he has strong 1v1 potential, making him favorable when Gragas tries to all-in.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be aware of Gragas's mana management in the early lane and to push the wave at the right moment when he uses Q. When Gragas tries to manage the wave with W, keeping a safe distance can waste his skills. Furthermore, engaging when Gragas's PR is on cooldown can leverage K'Sante's strengths. In team fights, it's crucial to prevent Gragas from using E on the carry, and attention must be paid to positioning with R.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and DPS, and can block Gragas's skills with his Wind Wall, making it easier to negate Gragas's attacks. Additionally, while Gragas has crowd control, Yasuo can engage and disengage with his E, allowing him to maneuver advantageously by avoiding Gragas's skills. Furthermore, after level 6, Yasuo can deal high burst damage to Gragas by repeatedly using his R in short skirmishes.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid Gragas's barrels in the early lane while stacking Q with minions. When Gragas charges in with his E, Yasuo can dodge with his E and aim to heal with W. After level 6, Yasuo can block Gragas's R with Wind Wall and then initiate an attack with E followed by R, creating a favorable situation against Gragas. Additionally, building MR as an item can effectively increase resistance to Gragas's magic damage. In team fights, it is crucial to be wary of Gragas's ult and CC while using Wind Wall to block attacks and aiming for burst damage in short moments.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility, making it easier to avoid Gragas's skills. Specifically, by dodging Gragas's E (Barrel), she can negate his crowd control and increase her chances to attack. Additionally, with a combo utilizing Quinn's passive, she can deal high burst damage to Gragas, making it particularly easy to harass during the laning phase. Furthermore, Gragas has low DPS and struggles with all-ins, allowing Quinn to play favorably.\n\nTo take advantage, first, choose Fleet Footwork to secure sustain in the lane. Next, rush to buy Static Shiv to enhance lane control and harass Gragas. While avoiding Gragas's skills, use E (Scout) to create distance and time your attacks. By being cautious of Gragas's R (Ultimate) and Body Slam, you can strike at the right moment to gain the upper hand.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick has sustained melee damage and significantly increases his combat power by using his R (the Maiden). Gragas has ranged attacks and knockbacks, but Yorick can apply pressure on his opponent by slowing them with his E while summoning the Maiden. Additionally, Gragas struggles with all-ins, especially after level 6 when he faces Yorick's R, putting him in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, push the minions while trading with slows from E. Be cautious of Gragas's barrels for ranged attacks, and aim for an all-in after summoning the Maiden. After level 6, you can play aggressively against Gragas using your R, and it's important to time jungle interventions to further extend your advantage. In team fights, enhance your side lane push and gain favorable 1v1s to contribute to the overall team.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is favored.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, as his Q scales infinitely with stacks. Gragas can disrupt Nasus's Q stacks in the early game, but once Nasus reaches level 6 and uses his R, he can stack his Q without difficulty and engage in 1v1 fights. Additionally, Nasus's W slow effect can hinder Gragas's E charge, making it easier for Nasus to create advantageous situations.\n\nTo gain an advantage, first choose Teleport and Flash as your summoner spells, and in the early game, it's important to use Q solely for last-hitting and not to attack recklessly. Stand in front of the minions to cut off Gragas's barrel line of sight, avoiding barrel damage. Use W to slow Gragas's E and call for assistance from your jungler to farm safely. After level 6, use R to stack Q without difficulty, and if you can safely stack under the tower, you will become a powerful presence in late-game team fights.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire scales well in the late game and team fights, and can avoid Gragas's E and R by using W (Pool). Gragas has strong harassment in the early game with his Q (Barrel), but Bloodmire can sustain through it with Q's healing, making it difficult for him to lose control by avoiding unnecessary skirmishes. Additionally, Gragas's skills have a slow activation time, allowing Bloodmire to look for counterattack opportunities while conserving his E.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (1-6), focus on CS while avoiding Gragas's barrels and prioritize healing with Q. It’s a good idea to engage in small skirmishes with Q→AA the moment Gragas misses his E. After level 6, use W to dodge Gragas's E and R, creating opportunities for counterattacks. The ideal timing to use R is when the opponent has exhausted their escape options. As for items, it’s important to buy Zhonya to enhance defense against Gragas's R and to increase damage with Liandry's and Rabadon's.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has close-range burst and reset capabilities, making her adept at attacking while avoiding Gragas's skills. Gragas excels at harassment and zoning with his ranged skills, but Irelia can aim for a guaranteed stun with her E and deal damage with short combos. Additionally, Gragas's skills have a slow activation time, especially his Q, which takes time to charge, allowing Irelia to exploit those openings to attack.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on avoiding the opponent's Q while prioritizing CS in the early lane phase, and aim for a guaranteed stun with E. After Gragas uses his E or Q, it's a good opportunity to engage with Irelia's E followed by rapid Q resets. Save W for when taking burst damage from the opponent, and after level 6, aim for an all-in if the opponent has no R or Flash. In team fights, it's important to engage from the side and use R to isolate or eliminate priority targets. Since Irelia is vulnerable to CC, try to act in coordination with your frontline allies."

      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick can easily turn the tide of the game with his R at level 6. Warwick has high healing capabilities and can deal significant damage, especially when his HP is low. Additionally, Warwick's Q provides healing, making prolonged fights often unfavorable for Mundo. Furthermore, Warwick has crowd control (CC) that can limit Mundo's movements, creating unfavorable situations for Mundo when he tries to engage in extended battles.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky 1v1s in the early lane phase and conserve health while harassing with Cleaver. Also, maintaining distance before taking Warwick's R and using your own R to endure and counterattack can be effective. Additionally, purchasing items with Grievous Wounds early on to reduce Warwick's healing is beneficial. It is also crucial to be aware of jungle interventions and coordinate with teammates to avoid ganks.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick's high healing ability and the crowd control from his R, which has suppression, are very effective against Gwen's playstyle. Gwen primarily fights around auto-attacks, but when she is affected by Warwick's Q fear effect, she becomes unable to attack and loses her advantage in trades. Additionally, Warwick has a powerful healing effect that increases as his HP decreases, so even if Gwen deals damage, there is a high chance that Warwick will heal it back. Furthermore, Gwen's skills are highly dependent on items, making it difficult to deal sufficient damage to Warwick in the early stages.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on farming and avoid giving away kills. It is effective to refrain from trading until Warwick's HP is below half, and if Ignite is available, to go all-in at that moment. Also, to avoid Warwick's Q, it is necessary to conserve dashes and attack when the fear effect has worn off. Repeatedly poke Warwick, use his barrier, and aim to finish him off with 4 stacks when he is at low HP. Additionally, freezing the lane to farm and trading near the tower can also be effective. This way, you can alleviate the disadvantage against Warwick and bring the matchup into a more favorable skill matchup in the late game.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and can deal significant damage, especially when his HP is low. Yorick relies on his pets, so his combat ability decreases when he doesn't have them. Additionally, Warwick's R (suppression) is very powerful, and even if Yorick tries to block his escape with walls, Warwick can quickly take him down by using his R. Furthermore, Warwick can heal while fighting in short trades, making it easier for him to counterattack even if Yorick pushes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to utilize Mist Walkers early in the lane to secure vision, apply the target with E, and aim for small heals with Q. Managing the wave effectively and always keeping Warwick close to the tower to isolate him is also effective. After level 6, entering fights after summoning the Maiden first can help avoid Warwick's R. Additionally, purchasing Bloodthirst (Brambles) early and choosing items that reduce Warwick's healing can enhance your ability to counter him.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high damage output in lane, especially with his ability to quickly reduce Irelia's HP. Warwick's sustain and durability are strong, and his healing effect increases when his HP is low, making it easier for him to take damage even when Irelia tries to engage in a fight. Additionally, Warwick's E skill's fear effect restricts Irelia's movement and makes it difficult for her to time her skills. Furthermore, Warwick scales well, which means that the disadvantage may continue into late-game duels.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase anti-heal items early and to have cloth armor to suppress Warwick's healing. Choosing Cleanse as a summoner spell can also make it easier to remove the fear from Warwick's E skill. However, since Cleanse does not work against Warwick's R, it may be worth considering Barrier or Exhaust as alternatives. By being mindful of positioning and using Flash appropriately, if you can avoid Warwick's attacks, you can turn the matchup in your favor.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Warwick's high healing ability and durability. Warwick has a powerful healing effect that increases as his HP decreases, allowing him to withstand Camille's burst damage, especially in skirmishes. Additionally, Warwick's R ability, which suppresses, can restrict Camille's mobility, making it easier for him to gain an advantage in close combat. Furthermore, Camille lacks AoE damage and has limited DPS in team fights and prolonged engagements, making it difficult to counter Warwick's sustained fighting.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it's important to focus on mini-trades and retreat immediately after attacking to minimize Warwick's healing from his Q. After level 6, it's effective to be cautious of Warwick's R and to take advantage of ally ganks to look for opportunities to take him down quickly. In terms of item selection, it's crucial to gather damage items early and aim for a quick resolution to prevent Warwick from utilizing his healing. Finally, securing vision and keeping track of Warwick's movements can help suppress his strengths.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Warwick's high healing ability and attack power in the early game. Warwick can deal damage primarily through auto-attacks while utilizing his Q for healing, making it easy for Bloodmire to fall behind in trades. Additionally, Warwick's R suppression nullifies Bloodmire's W (pool), increasing the risk of taking fatal damage. Furthermore, Bloodmire has a long cooldown in the early game and low DPS, making it difficult to counter Warwick.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use E to clear minions and secure healing with Q. Proper health management is crucial, and one must be aware of Warwick's Q and R range and cooldowns to maintain distance. Also, W (pool) should be conserved for positioning and avoiding dives, paying attention to the timing of suppression. In terms of item selection, prioritize health first, then purchase ability power and magic penetration early to enhance durability while dealing sustained damage.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Warwick's high healing ability and sustain. Warwick can heal himself with his Q and restrict Illaoi's movements with his R suppression. It is important for Illaoi to land her E to utilize her tentacles, but if Warwick dodges the E, Illaoi's means of dealing damage become limited. Additionally, Warwick is strong in short trades, and he may engage while healing before Illaoi can stack damage with her tentacles.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to use minions to position tentacles and create opportunities to land E. By engaging after forcing Warwick to use his Q or R, you can suppress his healing. In team fights, maintaining tentacles and coordinating with allies to control Warwick can be effective. Furthermore, creatively building items to increase durability is also important to withstand Warwick's attacks.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high sustain from the early game and can deal significant damage, especially when his HP is low. When trying to all-in, Tryndamere must be wary of Warwick's R (Suppression), as it makes it difficult for Tryndamere to land his attacks while Warwick's R is active. Additionally, Warwick's Q healing effect mitigates Tryndamere's damage, putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged trades. Furthermore, Tryndamere is weak against crowd control (CC), and if Warwick's CC skills restrict his movement, he becomes unable to attack and is more susceptible to damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky long trades in the early game and focus on short skirmishes. Try to avoid triggering Warwick's Q healing and maintain vision to keep an eye on jungle movements. Upon reaching level 6, use your R just before reaching 0 HP, adjusting the timing to avoid overlapping with Warwick's R. Additionally, purchasing Execution (Grievous Wounds) early can effectively reduce Warwick's healing. In team fights, it is crucial to position yourself to avoid being caught by Warwick and to utilize side pushes to create advantageous situations.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and chasing potential. Warwick's healing effect becomes stronger as his HP decreases, especially in short trades. While Malphite is durable, if he allows Warwick to engage with his E and heal with his Q, he can easily find himself at a disadvantage in a 1v1 brawl. Additionally, Malphite's hard CC is only his R, making it difficult to mitigate Warwick's attacks, which often puts him in unfavorable situations during skirmishes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Prioritize tank items**: Purchase items like Black Cleaver, Thornmail, and Stoneplate early to increase durability and reduce Warwick's damage.\n2. **Mana management**: Use Q to farm minions while using E to block Warwick's auto-attacks, conserving mana to ensure skills are available when needed.\n3. **Timing of engagements**: Before Warwick engages with his E, use E→W to absorb the damage and use R at the right moment to land CC, effectively nullifying Warwick's attacks.\n4. **Role in team fights**: In team fights, it is important to save R to counter enemy engages, protecting your carries while reducing the threat posed by Warwick.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that she can parry Warwick's CC from his R and E with her W, making it easier for Warwick to execute powerful follow-ups against Fiora. Additionally, Warwick has healing from his Q, which puts Fiora at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Fiora should aim for short skirmishes, but Warwick's healing makes that difficult. Furthermore, when there is a health difference, Warwick can use his R to secure kills, so Fiora needs to be cautious.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Fiora to utilize minions to gain an advantage. Prioritizing vitals with Q and E, and parrying Warwick's skills with W, can negate his CC. Also, using her R under the tower or in bushes to secure kills can be effective. By avoiding prolonged fights and focusing on short skirmishes, Fiora can leverage her strengths while minimizing Warwick's healing.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and is a strong champion in short trades. Particularly, due to Warwick's sustain from his Q, even if Anbessa initiates an attack, Warwick can easily recover from that damage, potentially gaining an advantage in sustained trades. Additionally, Warwick's R has a guaranteed suppression, making Anbessa vulnerable to counterattacks if caught when engaging. Furthermore, Warwick excels in close-range brawls, creating situations where Anbessa cannot fully utilize his mobility.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky trades in the early game and prioritize minion farming and passive charge. It is necessary to time Warwick's Q healing and endure damage while using W for shielding. Also, utilizing E's slow to create distance and evade Warwick's attacks can be effective. After level 6, using R to separate Warwick and coordinating with allies to attack can create opportunities to seize control. In prolonged fights, it is crucial to be aware of Warwick's healing while disengaging and re-engaging at the right moments.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has overwhelming strength against Kled. Warwick's Q has high damage and healing effects, making it easier for him to sustain when Kled tries to engage in a fight. Additionally, Warwick's R suppression prevents Kled from remounting, taking away Kled's escape options and chances to counterattack. Furthermore, Warwick has been buffed in recent patches, particularly with the \"Blade of Ruin\" buff, making the situation increasingly difficult for Kled.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, one option is to completely abandon the top lane or aim for proxy farming with Tiamat. This allows Kled to avoid direct confrontations with Warwick while still earning gold. It is also important for Kled to choose a bruiser build rather than a full damage build to increase durability and withstand fights against Warwick. Additionally, closely observing Warwick's movements and avoiding his skills can help alleviate the disadvantage, even if just a little.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick is very strong from the early game and can gain an advantage over Garen, especially in one-on-one trades. Warwick's passive and Q healing effects can easily offset Garen's damage, and Warwick's R suppression limits Garen's actions. Additionally, Warwick excels in close combat and can continue to deal damage even while affected by Garen's silence, making it necessary for Garen to avoid trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm safely and endure until level 6. If Warwick has his barrier, it is effective to avoid one-on-one fights and wait for ganks. Also, purchasing Bramble Vest or Executioner's Calling early and having Ignite can help suppress Warwick's healing. Paying attention to wave management and seeking help from the jungler to prevent Warwick from creating advantageous situations is also crucial. Acting calmly and avoiding getting drawn into trades is key for Garen."
    },
    "loses": {
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has high poke ability in short trades, and especially in the early game, he can frequently deal damage to Warwick using his Q. Additionally, Urgot can pull the opponent with his E, making it easier to manage distance and prevent Warwick from closing in. Furthermore, Urgot's shields and crowd control make it easier to negate Warwick's sustain, allowing Urgot to come out ahead in short skirmishes.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important to poke Warwick with Q and avoid extended trades. By using E to maintain distance from Warwick and following up with W to deal damage, you can accumulate pressure. Additionally, preparing healing reduction (Brambles) and early armor can help diminish Warwick's sustain. After level 6, utilizing Urgot's R to secure kills and aim for a snowball effect is effective. It is also crucial to remain vigilant against ganks and use vision to create advantageous situations.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, especially in prolonged fights. While Warwick has a powerful healing effect that increases as his HP decreases, Singed's poison damage over time can surpass Warwick's healing. Additionally, Singed can use Fling (E) to pull Warwick under his own tower or into an unfavorable position, effectively neutralizing Warwick's strengths.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to quickly push the minions early on and harass Warwick with Poison (Q). While being mindful of Warwick's healing, one should avoid unnecessary engagements. When it is safe, proxy farm to earn experience while creating opportunities for roams and side pressure. Before engaging, maintain distance from Warwick's melee Q and Blood Hunt, and be careful not to get surrounded by bushes or minion waves. After level 6, it is crucial to be aware of Warwick's ultimate and avoid acting alone, coordinating with teammates instead. By using Fling to isolate Warwick, you can turn the fight in your favor.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum can deal high damage in short skirmishes, allowing him to inflict damage before Warwick's healing can kick in. In particular, the damage from Braum's auto-attacks after using his E is very powerful, enabling him to engage before Warwick can heal with his Q. Additionally, Braum has skills that can stun, making it easier to limit Warwick's movements and gain an advantage against him after he uses his R.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (levels 1-5), Braum should use his E to initiate short skirmishes and continuously deal damage to prevent Warwick from healing with his Q. After level 6, while being cautious of Warwick's R, he should look for opportunities to counterattack using minions and walls. By preparing anti-healing items (like Mortal Reminder), Braum can suppress Warwick's sustain and maintain an advantage even in prolonged fights.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar can safely stack his Q in lane, and especially when taking damage from Warwick, he can use W (Wither) to significantly reduce Warwick's attack speed and movement speed. This allows Gnar to mitigate Warwick's strength in trades, and after lowering Warwick's armor with E, Gnar can deal damage with Q. Additionally, Gnar has high mobility in mini form, allowing him to maneuver while avoiding Warwick's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to conserve Q at the start of the lane and consistently last-hit minions. Between levels 3 and 5, use E to aim for armor reduction, and when taking damage from Warwick, use W to limit his movements. After level 6, it's crucial to be wary of Warwick's R while timing W for counterattacks. In team fights, Gnar should maintain the frontline while targeting isolated enemies with Warwick. Building early armor items will enhance durability and allow for favorable trades against Warwick.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has high burst damage from the early game and can execute powerful all-ins, especially in 1v1 trades. While Warwick is strong in sustained fights, he struggles in early skirmishes due to his low HP, allowing Pantheon to deal early damage with his Q and E attacks. Additionally, by utilizing Pantheon’s stun (E), you can prevent Warwick from retaliating, making it easier to maintain the advantage.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, it is important to actively trade between levels 1 and 3 to chip away at Warwick's HP. Specifically, you should aim to deal damage with Q when Warwick has used his skills and is vulnerable, and then land a stun with E to put significant pressure on him. After level 6, be cautious of Warwick's R (Suppression) while securing vision and taking the initiative in team fights, as this will lead to victory. By being mindful of ganks around the dragon and in the lane, and by limiting Warwick's movements, you can steer the match in your favor.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in early short trades; he can pull the opponent with his Q, silence them with his E, and maximize his passive with auto-attacks. While Warwick has high sustain, he cannot keep up with Darius's short burst damage, making Darius particularly favored from levels 1 to 3. Additionally, Darius's R has a powerful execution mechanic, allowing him to create even more advantageous situations by securing kills.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be aggressive between levels 1 and 3. Pull Warwick with your Q, silence him with your E, and then build up your passive with auto-attacks. If Warwick retaliates, mitigate damage with your E while continuing to trade and heal with your Q. After level 6, you can either use your R to finish off Warwick or retreat safely after using R to maximize Darius's strengths. It is also important to create an item advantage; if Darius can deal damage first, victory will be within reach.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes Ranged after level 6, allowing for sustained harassment and kiting. Warwick is a melee champion and is particularly strong in early skirmishes, but Kail becomes stronger as she levels up and has an R that creates invulnerability, allowing her to avoid Warwick's attacks. Additionally, Kail can use skills that apply slows to maintain distance from Warwick and hinder his approach.\n\nTo take advantage, initially prioritize farming and be careful not to lose HP. Avoid 1v1 encounters with Warwick, especially before he gets Divine Sunderer. Once you reach level 6, use your R to negate Warwick's attacks while dealing damage with Q and applying slows with E to keep your distance. In team fights, it's important to focus on fighting from the front to the back and to position yourself to avoid being flanked by Warwick. This way, Kail can create a favorable situation against Warwick.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has high 1v1 performance and is particularly strong against Warwick, who relies on auto-attacks. By tanking with Shen's E and blocking Warwick's auto-attacks, you can reduce his damage. Additionally, Shen's R allows him to support allies from infinite range, making it easier for Shen to intervene when Warwick targets isolated low HP enemies. Furthermore, Shen can disrupt Warwick's R with his E, providing an opportunity to negate Warwick's suppression.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid Warwick's Q during the laning phase. After Warwick uses Q, attack with E and save W to prevent damage from auto-attacks. In short trades, use E to tank and aim for a burst with Q. If Warwick uses his R, disrupting it with E is effective, and if caught, waiting for allies or countering with R is advisable. In terms of item selection, prioritize defensive gear to hinder sustain and limit Warwick's healing. In team fights, it is crucial to utilize Shen's R to create advantageous situations and be mindful of positioning when Warwick targets isolated low HP enemies.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control (CC) and is particularly strong in short-term skirmishes. While Warwick has high healing, K'Sante can use his CC to disrupt Warwick's healing. Additionally, K'Sante's damage increases in all-out situations, enhancing his one-on-one performance, making it easier to gain the upper hand in trades against Warwick.\n\nTo leverage this advantage, first, purchase a Bramble Vest at the start of the laning phase to suppress Warwick's healing from his Q. In the early laning phase, initiate short trades to chip away at Warwick's HP and force him to manage his minion health, making it harder for him to use his Q. In the mid-game, it is crucial to look for opportunities when Warwick is isolated and use your R to catch him. In team fights, K'Sante should absorb damage at the front and prioritize stopping Warwick's engage, creating a favorable situation for allies to fight.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has skills that enhance his basic attacks, making him particularly good at a playstyle that relies on auto-attacks. Warwick has a powerful healing effect that increases as his HP decreases, but Jax can negate Warwick's attacks and stun him by using his E ability. This allows Jax to suppress Warwick's strength in trades, especially when both are at low HP.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to bully Warwick from level 1. Push the lane to the tower and keep track of the enemy jungler, mid, and support movements. During trades, before level 6, avoid using E too early and try to use it when Warwick is at low HP. After level 6, engage in short trades, build up your AA passive on minions, and then go all-in to gain the upper hand against Warwick.\n\nAdditionally, by choosing items like Divine Sunderer and Bramble Vest, you can reduce Warwick's healing and fight even more effectively. Having Teleport also allows you to gain an advantage in macro play, so it is important to play strategically.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has the advantage.\n\nTeemo has a long range and can negate Warwick's auto-attacks with his Q (Blind). This allows Teemo to safely harass even when Warwick tries to engage in a fight, giving him an edge, especially in early skirmishes. Additionally, Teemo's zoning ability with his mushrooms can limit Warwick's movements and secure vision.\n\nTo take advantage, first, maintain distance while harassing with Q, and when Warwick approaches, use the bushes to place mushrooms. This way, you can deal damage as Warwick gets closer while ensuring an escape route. It's also important to always be mindful of your positioning to avoid Warwick's W (Chase Low Health) and retreat when necessary. In team fights, Teemo can use mushrooms to restrict enemy movements and prevent Warwick from catching the carries.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, as his damage scales infinitely by stacking his Q. Additionally, by using W (Wither), he can reduce Warwick's chasing power, especially when Warwick uses his ultimate; by applying W, he can lower Warwick's movement and attack speed, significantly reducing his damage. Furthermore, Nasus can build tanky, making him durable and easier to survive in team fights.\n\nTo gain an advantage, it is important to safely last-hit minions with Q between levels 1 and 3 while avoiding direct confrontations. Save W and focus on freezing the wave near your tower to stack Q. Be cautious of Warwick's E+Q combo and Blood Hunt engage, and consider countering with Bramble and armor items without forcing fights. When Warwick charges in with his ultimate, you can mitigate his damage by using W first to create distance while stacking Q.\n\nIn the mid to late game, Nasus should prioritize CS and Q stacks, focusing on split-pushing and side lanes during team fights. When facing Warwick, you can hold him with your team's CC and W, allowing for a prolonged fight that leverages Nasus's strengths.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven is a champion that excels in short-term burst damage and can deal high damage to Warwick. By utilizing Riven's combo (Q→AA→Q), it is possible to deal damage instantly while ignoring Warwick's healing. Additionally, Riven has plenty of blinks and crowd control, making it easier to avoid Warwick's suppression and follow-up attacks. Furthermore, Riven can push the lane quickly, making it easier to create a level advantage and secure an early lead.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use Riven's burst in the early game to deal damage with short combos and avoid prolonged fights. While being cautious of Warwick's healing from Q and low-health tracking with W, push the lane to create a level difference. After level 6, Warwick's ultimate becomes powerful, so it is crucial to secure vision and maintain distance with Flash or sidesteps when isolated. Additionally, purchasing Ignite or healing reduction items like Grievous Wounds early, and focusing on burst damage rather than tankiness, is an effective strategy. It is also advisable to practice disengaging immediately after using E (shield) to land your combo.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in the lane. In particular, he can deal damage to Warwick from a distance using his Q skill while healing and removing crowd control with his W skill. Additionally, since Warwick's healing effect is enhanced when his HP is below 50%, Gangplank can take advantage of this by attacking before that threshold.\n\nTo gain the advantage, the first goal is to reduce Warwick's HP to 50%. Once it drops below that, his passive healing will no longer function, creating an opportunity for an all-in. Furthermore, if you have Ignite, it is important to use it proactively to prevent Warwick's healing and to purchase Executioner's Calling to suppress his recovery. Proper wave management is also crucial; zoning Warwick so he cannot farm will help maintain lane dominance. It is also important to avoid playing too aggressively and to predict Warwick's movements to dodge his attacks.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn possesses high mobility and burst damage, and has strong denial capabilities, especially against melee champions. While Warwick is strong in brawls, Quinn excels at harassing from a distance and in short trades, allowing her to attack in a way that prevents Warwick from utilizing his healing. Additionally, Quinn's skills can restrict Warwick's movements, and particularly with her ultimate, she can quickly reposition to avoid Warwick's ultimate.\n\nTo take advantage, start by harassing from a distance in small increments until level 3, while gauging Warwick's engage timing. From levels 3 to 5, hit with skills briefly and then disengage quickly, attacking more aggressively in sync with Warwick's healing actions to maximize damage efficiency. After level 6, actively roam, and if Warwick's ultimate is used, it's crucial to escape to a location with allies. By constantly managing distance and prioritizing a position that avoids crowd control, you can maximize Quinn's strengths.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble can utilize his skills to deal high damage, making it easier to gain the upper hand in a brawl against Warwick. In particular, Rumble's Q skill is effective for poking, allowing him to deal damage before Warwick can get close. Additionally, by managing his heat gauge, Rumble can sustain his attacks, dealing damage that surpasses Warwick's healing effects.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to constantly use the Q skill for poking and whittling down Warwick's HP. When Warwick approaches, use the W skill to shield and counter his attacks. Furthermore, using the E skill to create distance is crucial to make it difficult for Warwick to engage. Finally, using the R skill in team fights or one-on-one situations allows Rumble to exert high pressure and effectively eliminate Warwick. By employing these tactics, Rumble can fight favorably against Warwick.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has traits that allow him to easily overpower Warwick in early skirmishes. Olaf's E deals true damage, allowing him to inflict damage while ignoring Warwick's healing effects. Additionally, Olaf's R negates crowd control, enabling him to attack while avoiding the suppression from Warwick's R. This allows Olaf to create favorable situations against Warwick.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (1-3), it is important to aggressively farm CS with Q while dealing true damage with E in short trades. Before level 6, be cautious of Warwick's healing and chasing potential, and securing vision to invite ganks from allies is effective. After level 6, use R to negate crowd control, and approach with E+Q to deal burst damage, gaining an advantage over Warwick. In team fights, it is crucial to conserve R and focus on dealing damage from behind the tank, while using Q to create distance when escaping.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo can utilize his high mobility and shield to fight against Warwick in the early lane. While Warwick has healing from his Q, Yasuo can suppress Warwick's healing by engaging in short trades. Additionally, Yasuo can use his E to maneuver around minions, creating distance to avoid Warwick's attacks, which is particularly effective for dodging Warwick's R (suppression).\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, prioritize safety first, poking with Q while conserving Flow (shield). It’s important to avoid prolonged trades considering Warwick's Q healing and deal damage in short bursts. Use E to maneuver around minions for escape and positioning, forcing Warwick to use his E (damage reduction → fear) before engaging. Furthermore, by using Wind Wall to block Warwick's attacks and coordinating with allies for knock-ups to combine with R, Yasuo can maintain an advantageous position in team fights."

      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Akali's high mobility and burst damage. Akali can deal damage with short skill combos using her Q and E, and she can avoid Malphite's R with her smoke screen. Additionally, after reaching level 6, Akali has a strong ability to assassinate, making it easier for her to deal damage even if Malphite builds armor by being mindful of magic penetration. Furthermore, Akali can harass from outside Malphite's range, allowing her to maintain an advantageous position in skirmishes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important for Malphite to build armor items early (the first being Bramble or Knight) to reduce Akali's reliance on auto-attacks. Additionally, managing the minion wave and avoiding Akali's approach is necessary. Upon reaching level 6, securing vision and looking for opportunities to catch Akali with R can be effective. In team fights, it is crucial for Malphite to use R at the front line to prevent Akali from finding opportunities to assassinate.",
      "ケイル": "Kayn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and the ability to quickly close the gap and deal burst damage. Especially after level 6, Akali can use her blink to approach Kayn and deal significant damage in a short amount of time. Additionally, Kayn is very weak in the early game and is susceptible to Akali's attacks before reaching level 6, making her vulnerable to ganks as well. Furthermore, Akali's smoke screen obstructs vision, making it difficult for Kayn to attack safely.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, prioritize CS in the early game, carry extra potions to avoid Akali's attacks, and focus on healing. It is also important to use the positioning of minions to place wards and keep track of Akali's movements. After level 6, it is necessary to utilize range to attack from a distance and conserve the ultimate to avoid Akali's burst. In team fights, positioning in the backline and utilizing allies' crowd control to counter Akali is effective.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and short burst damage, allowing her to gain an advantage in short trades, especially between levels 2 and 5. By using her W, Akali can avoid Gwen's R and E, and if the fight drags on, Gwen's damage output decreases. Additionally, Akali becomes vulnerable when she misses her skills, so taking damage from Akali can quickly put Gwen in a disadvantageous position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to manage minions thoroughly in the early lane phase and conserve Akali's skills. By forcing Akali to use her W and E first, Gwen can create opportunities to close the gap with E and deal damage with Q or auto-attacks. Also, aiming for level 6, it's crucial to save W to dodge Akali's skills and to time R before taking damage from her attacks. Coordination with the jungle is also important; attacking when Akali has no W or Flash can create a favorable situation against her.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and burst damage, allowing her to quickly eliminate Cho'Gath, especially with her combos after level 6. She can use the stealth effect from her W to avoid Cho'Gath's skills while closing in to attack. Additionally, Akali can avoid the silence from Cho'Gath's W, making it easy for her to counterattack even if Cho'Gath tries to engage. Furthermore, Akali has strong pushing power, while Cho'Gath's wave clear ability is limited, making it easy for her to take control of the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to use E behind minions to avoid Akali's attacks. Also, it is necessary to be cautious of Akali's W and to save your own W to time the silence when she approaches. After level 6, utilizing R to apply pressure and prevent Akali from escaping can be effective. Additionally, managing vision and coordinating with teammates to create opportunities to catch Akali can help turn the matchup in your favor.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and burst damage. Akali can use up to four consecutive blinks to close the gap and eliminate Teemo in one hit. Additionally, Akali can utilize the invulnerability effect from her W to dodge Teemo's attacks, making Teemo's blind effect less effective. Furthermore, after level 6, Akali can deal significant damage, and if Teemo is trapped by mushrooms, his escape options become limited.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important for Teemo to deal consistent damage with his auto-attacks and Q while conserving Akali's skills. Placing mushrooms in the bushes to secure vision and using them to deal damage while maintaining distance when Akali approaches is crucial. Also, purchasing boots early to increase mobility will make it easier to avoid Akali's attacks. After level 6, it is effective to time Akali's attacks and block her approach with mushrooms before counterattacking. Depending on the situation, choosing a build that emphasizes sustained damage can help Teemo trade favorably against Akali.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has burst damage and high mobility after level 6, allowing her to deal burst damage that surpasses Ornn's durability. Akali excels at cutting vision with her W (Twilight Shroud) and exploiting Ornn's openings with her R. Additionally, Ornn requires preparation to apply crowd control, making it difficult to respond to a highly mobile opponent like Akali. Furthermore, Akali can avoid Ornn's skills, reducing his opportunities to deal damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is crucial to manage minions thoroughly and be careful not to take harassment from Akali. Using W (Bellows Breath) to silence Akali when she uses her W (Twilight Shroud) is important to reduce damage. Additionally, building magic resistance items early can help mitigate Akali's magic damage and increase durability. After level 6, it is essential to check for Akali's R and the presence of ally crowd control, and to play safely without forcing engagements. In team fights, stepping forward to absorb damage and preventing Akali's entry can contribute to the overall victory of the team.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and instant burst damage, making it particularly easy for her to dodge Warwick's skills. Akali's W creates a smoke screen that obscures vision, making it difficult for Warwick to approach. Additionally, Akali can use her stealth to avoid Warwick's attacks and can also evade the suppression from Warwick's R. Furthermore, Akali has strong pushing power and can easily gain early lane control, which puts Warwick under pressure in the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to place wards properly to secure vision and understand the effects of Akali's W. After Akali uses her W, look for an opportunity to approach with E and time your attack while healing with Q. Also, before taking Akali's burst damage, use E to reduce incoming damage and create a timing to land your R effectively. In team fights, focus on isolating Akali and work with your teammates to ensure she is taken down.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has powerful burst damage after level 6, and there is a risk of losing HP instantly when she uses her R (Perfect Execution). Additionally, Akali's high mobility and four consecutive blinks often allow her to escape before Nar can land an attack or, conversely, to attack Nar. Furthermore, Akali can use her smoke screen to obscure vision, making it difficult for Nar to utilize his CC (crowd control).\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Level 1-3 Playstyle**: Utilize early harassment while avoiding Akali's skills and dealing damage with Q (Boulder Toss). Be wary of Akali's E (Shadow Step) and aim for openings after she uses her skills.\n\n2. **Minion Management**: Manage minions effectively to prevent Akali from getting CS. Use Nar's passive (Rage) to build up rage and time the transformation into Mega Nar.\n\n3. **Item Build**: Purchase armor items (e.g., Nashor's Tooth) early to reduce Akali's damage. Also, consider items with magic resistance (e.g., Banshee's Veil) to better withstand Akali's burst.\n\n4. **Role in Team Fights**: In team fights, utilize CC and keep track of Akali's position to protect the backline. It is crucial to use Mega Nar's R (Transformation) to group enemies before Akali can get close.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to counter Akali as Nar.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and burst damage, and her ultimate ability after level 6 poses a significant threat with its instant damage. Darius has a short range and low mobility, making him susceptible to Akali's attacks. If she uses her W or smoke screen to reposition before he can engage, it becomes difficult for him to initiate. Additionally, Akali can secure an escape route with her short combos, often getting away before Darius can initiate a long trade.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Be aware of Akali's W cooldown and engage when it is unavailable.\n2. Use minions to dodge Akali's E, increasing the chances of getting close.\n3. Purchase Bramble Vest as an item to reduce Akali's healing, allowing for sustained fights.\n4. In team fights, focus on other enemy champions instead of targeting Akali, and maneuver to avoid her burst damage.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and burst damage in the early game, making it easy for her to apply pressure while Nasus is trying to farm. Akali can use her W (Shroud) to block vision, making it difficult for Nasus to approach. Additionally, Nasus is very weak in the early game and needs to target minions to stack his Q, but he can easily be zoned out by Akali's attacks. Furthermore, since Akali does not have hard CC, she can prevent Nasus from getting close, giving her a high win rate in one-on-one encounters.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to secure vision first. Placing wards to track Akali's movements and maintaining distance before she uses her W (Shroud) is necessary. Additionally, pushing the minions before Akali roams can limit her movements and allow Nasus to continue farming. Buying Mercury's Treads or Spirit Visage early can also be effective in reducing Akali's damage. In team fights, it is crucial to maintain the frontline rather than prioritizing taking down Akali, while using W (Wither) to prevent her from chasing.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Akali's high mobility and burst damage. Akali excels at using her smoke to obscure vision and quickly deal damage upon closing the gap. Braum's main skills have short range, making him susceptible to Akali's attacks, and it is particularly difficult to retaliate against Akali while she is in stealth. Additionally, Akali is good at wave clearing, so when Braum attempts to push, there is a high chance that Akali will take control. Furthermore, Akali is also strong against champions with hard crowd control, so Braum's shield and stun from his E often do not function effectively.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to safely manage minions in the early game and deflect Akali's harassment. Approach with Q, attack with W while healing, and use E for shielding to engage in sustained fights. Also, placing wards during Akali's smoke to secure vision and coordinating with allies to corner Akali can be effective. Additionally, utilizing teleport to return or using ignite to aim for kills can increase options to counter Akali. It is also important to focus on durability and magic resistance in items to reduce Akali's damage.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali's smoke screen (W) obscures vision, making it difficult for Camille to land her E knock-up and R isolation. Akali has high mobility and can easily dodge Camille's skills using the smoke screen, especially increasing the risk of burst damage after level 6. Additionally, Akali can bait Camille's E and R, making it easier for her to time her attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Position the lane minions closer to your side to create a situation where Akali finds it hard to approach.\n2. Attack after forcing Akali to use her smoke screen, wasting her skill.\n3. Calmly counterattack after Akali uses her E or R. Particularly, after Akali uses her skills, it’s a chance to capitalize on Camille's burst damage.\n4. If possible, coordinate with your support or jungler to aim for a gank and apply pressure on Akali.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, Camille can alleviate her disadvantage and create a more favorable situation.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high mobility and burst damage, making it easy for her to take down Renekton, especially in all-ins after level 6. Akali's smoke screen obscures vision, and her passive and Q slow effect increase the risk of losing HP before getting close. Additionally, Akali can trade while Renekton's skills are on cooldown, and if Renekton cannot manage his fury, the power of his combos decreases. Furthermore, Akali has strong lane-pushing power against Renekton, creating situations where it is difficult for Renekton to gain control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Renekton to utilize \"Doran's Shield\" and \"Second Wind\" to enhance his sustain during levels 1-5. Also, to avoid Akali's all-ins, it is effective to refrain from hard pushing the lane and focus on trading in longer lanes. Moreover, being cautious of skirmishes with Akali's jungle and coordinating with the allied jungler to set up ganks when necessary can apply pressure on Akali. Finally, prioritizing MR and HP in the build is also crucial to withstand Akali's all-ins.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali has high burst damage after level 6, and she excels in close combat, especially in her stealth state after using W. Garen can interrupt Akali's skills with his Q, but Akali has up to four consecutive blinks, making it difficult for Garen to approach and more likely to get hit by Akali's combo. Additionally, Akali has ways to avoid Garen's silence, and managing the cooldown of her W is particularly important. Furthermore, Akali's defensive capabilities do not change against area attacks, so taking her skills can quickly deplete Garen's health.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forced close combat in the early game and apply pressure under the tower while using minions to manage E. After Akali uses her W, it is crucial to stay away until she becomes visible, and to carefully time Q for trades. Also, when using R at level 6, if Akali's health is low, it is essential to secure the kill, and if she can escape, adjusting the timing is important. By placing vision in bushes and being aware of roaming and side lane responses, Garen can deal high damage in team fights as well.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Akali's high mobility and burst damage. Akali excels at using smoke to obscure vision and initiate ambushes. Fiora can negate Akali's CC and burst with her W (Riposte), but Akali's attacks are fast, and if Fiora misses her W against a full combo after level 6, she can take significant damage. Additionally, Akali can easily roam using her mobility in lane, making it difficult for Fiora to seize control during that time. Furthermore, Akali can easily take control from the early game against Fiora, who has low pushing power.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Lane Management**: Fiora should avoid pushing the lane too much and farm safely while watching the opponent's movements. It's important to be wary of Akali's roams and secure vision.\n2. **W Timing**: It is crucial to prepare W just before Akali's dashes or R to look for counterattack opportunities. By using W effectively, Fiora can negate Akali's attacks and deal damage in return.\n3. **Item Build**: Fiora should purchase defensive items early to reduce Akali's burst damage. Additionally, choosing items that enhance sustain can improve her ability to maintain lane presence.\n4. **Team Coordination**: Fiora should avoid acting alone and work with teammates to target Akali, creating more favorable situations. Especially when receiving a gank, it is important to use Fiora's W to create opportunities for counterattacks."

    "loses": {
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce can easily harass Akali from the early game using his long range, dealing high damage by combining his Q and E abilities. Additionally, Akali has low pushing power in the early game, making it difficult for her to retaliate against Jayce's harassment. Furthermore, Jayce has crowd control skills, allowing him to limit Akali's movement with knockback when she tries to engage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Jayce to maintain distance while using minions as a shield, harassing with Q, and safely creating distance with E (Gate). By timing his all-in with W (Hammer) when Akali's W (Smoke) or Flash is unavailable, he can go for an aggressive play. Additionally, pushing to create side lane advantage allows for roaming and influencing other lanes. It is also crucial to use wards to safely maneuver and reduce Akali's vision.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven has several advantages against Akali. First, Riven has high burst damage from the early game and can use her stun to limit Akali's movements. Akali has low pushing power in the early game and is susceptible to taking damage early on from Riven's attacks. Additionally, Riven can maximize her damage by using her skills in succession, allowing her to aim for a quick finish before Akali can retaliate.\n\nTo take advantage, start by using Q for a short auto-attack from the beginning of the lane until level 3, and aim for a stun with W. It is important to attack right after Akali uses her W or when her Q is on cooldown. Between levels 3 and 5, avoid long trades and engage in short bursts with the W stun → AA → Q combo. By using E to shield against Akali's E, you can continue attacking while mitigating damage and aiming for a counterattack.\n\nAfter level 6, it is effective to secure vision when Akali goes invisible with her W and to finish her off with a full burst (E → Q → W → R → AA) after she uses her R or W. Additionally, since Akali can roam easily, it is important to secure vision and avoid overcommitting. This way, Riven can maintain a favorable situation against Akali.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has range and excels at dealing sustained damage. Akali is a melee assassin, and when she takes hits from Urgot's auto-attacks and Q, it becomes difficult for her to engage. Additionally, Urgot has crowd control and can predict Akali's dashes with his E to counterattack. While Akali has high burst damage, Urgot's durability and shields allow him to maintain an advantage in extended fights.\n\nTo take advantage, push Akali in the early lane to deny her CS. Use Urgot's W to zone her and look for counterattacks while reading her movements with E. It’s important to use R to secure kills when Akali is low on health. Also, pay attention to Akali's shadow movements and position yourself to prevent her from roaming. In team fights, hold the frontline and prioritize taking down squishy enemies to maximize Urgot's strengths.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has strong 1v1 capabilities, especially against Akali, who relies heavily on auto-attacks. By using Shen's E (Taunt), you can limit Akali's attacks while dealing damage with your Q. Additionally, Shen's R (Teleport) provides a shield that mitigates Akali's burst damage, allowing you to gain an advantage in team fights and when supporting allies.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to safely maintain your lane in the early game and not to engage recklessly while being cautious of Akali's W (Smoke). After Akali uses her W or when her E is on cooldown, you can engage with your E, use Taunt to ensure your Q hits, allowing you to deal damage while restricting Akali's actions. Furthermore, after level 6, you can utilize your R to support allies while applying pressure in side lanes, creating favorable situations against Akali.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration and the invincibility trait from his ultimate, allowing him to withstand Akali's burst damage. While Akali can gain an advantage in early trades, Tremendous has high sustained combat ability, especially after level 6, when he can safely attack using his ultimate. Additionally, Akali is weak against sustained pressure and cannot compete with Tremendous's healing in prolonged fights.\n\nTo gain an advantage, it is important to prioritize CS in the early game and safely build up rage. Using a hit-and-run strategy helps avoid Akali's E→Q combo and prevents short trades. Once reaching level 6, Tremendous can confidently engage, looking for opportunities to counterattack when Akali tries to strike. Maintaining vision and being wary of Akali's roams will help keep an advantage in lane. If an item lead is established, Tremendous becomes even more advantageous, ensuring victory by dragging the fight into the late game.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, which provides means to counter Akali's high mobility. In particular, Gragas can harass Akali from a distance with his Q and heal while absorbing damage with his W. Additionally, by using his R to disrupt Akali's positioning, he can prevent her from dashing or diving, allowing him to maintain an advantage over her.\n\nTo take advantage, at the start of the lane, Gragas should push the minions with his Q while harassing Akali. It is important to be cautious of Akali approaching and to use E to engage while staying outside of her shadow. When reaching level 6, since Akali may use her R to attack, it is wise to conserve his R, engage with E, endure with W, and create distance with R if necessary. In the mid-game and beyond, if Akali is isolated, he should use R to disrupt her position and look for opportunities to take her down with his teammates. By being mindful of Akali's shadow cooldown management and ensuring his skills hit, Gragas can maximize his advantage.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high sustain and can withstand Akali's short burst damage. While Akali has high burst damage, Dr. Mundo's healing ability allows him to mitigate that damage, making him strong in prolonged fights. Additionally, Mundo has a passive that negates hard crowd control, allowing him to maneuver without worrying about Akali's CC.\n\nTo take advantage of this, in the early laning phase, prioritize using Q to safely harass while managing minions. When Akali approaches, avoid engaging unnecessarily and focus on farming under the tower while creating a health advantage. After level 6, be cautious of Akali's R and conserve your own R to prepare for withstanding her burst. In team fights, it's important to endure at the frontline while spreading AoE damage and positioning yourself to avoid being the initial focus of Akali. When Akali attempts to flank, you can use Mundo's durability to protect your team.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo possesses high mobility and knock-up against Akali, allowing him to neutralize her attacks. In particular, Yasuo's Q3 knock-up can incapacitate Akali before she can unleash her burst damage, and even if Akali uses her smoke screen, Yasuo can block projectiles with his W while closing the distance. Additionally, all of Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, making it easier to deal sustained damage and chip away at Akali's HP.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to prioritize CS in the early game and not to engage recklessly, instead using E to step on minions and stack Q. While being mindful of Akali's Q range, save W to block projectiles. After level 6, aim for an aerial knock-up with Tornado (Q3) and coordinate with R to deal significant damage to Akali. Also, prioritize building magic resistance items, and in team fights, if there are multiple knock-up targets with R, engage to effectively eliminate Akali.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon is very strong from levels 1 to 3 in the early game and can gain an advantage in short skirmishes. By utilizing Pantheon's Q and E, he can easily engage in short trades against Akali and deal burst damage. Additionally, Akali has low pushing power in the early game and is particularly susceptible to losing health when taking Pantheon's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first use Q and E from levels 1 to 3 and actively engage in short trades. By retreating immediately after taking damage from Akali, you can minimize damage while applying pressure on the opponent. Also, you should push the wave towards the opponent's tower or freeze it to be wary of Akali's roams. Choosing Ignite as a summoner spell increases kill pressure, allowing you to gain an edge over Akali. After level 6, Akali's counterplay potential increases, so it is important to play carefully and manage vision while fighting.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has strong harassment capabilities from the early game and can deal sustained damage to Akali. In particular, he can attack Akali through minions using Q (Flamespitter) to aim for healing and CS disruption. Additionally, by using W to reduce damage taken while increasing movement speed, it becomes easier to prevent Akali from closing in. Furthermore, by utilizing the slow effect from E (Electro Harpoon), Rumble can limit Akali's movements and gain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first, harass Akali with Q until level 3, and maintain the lane safely by utilizing damage reduction from W. After level 3, repeatedly apply the combo of slowing with E and chasing with Q to establish dominance over Akali. Be careful not to push the minions too much and play cautiously of Akali's roams. After level 6, while being wary of Akali's burst, use R (Equalizer) to cut off escape routes or as a source of damage when cornering her. By purchasing Zhonya's early, Rumble can deflect Akali's attacks and work with teammates in team fights to reliably take her down.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at poking from a distance, and his Q is particularly effective for harassment. Akali has low pushing power in the early game and is susceptible to damage from Gangplank's Q, making it easier for him to gain lane control. Additionally, Gangplank's W can remove crowd control, allowing him to mitigate Akali's attacks. Furthermore, Gangplank's R is an infinite range damage skill, making it easy to participate in team fights and intervene in other lanes.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, safely poke Akali with Q while placing barrels at the lane's edge or in brushes to create escape routes. When Akali approaches, use barrels to maintain distance, and after level 6, utilize R to apply pressure. It's also important to be mindful of barrel placement to avoid Akali's skills. When Akali uses her shadow to attack, use barrels to keep your distance while looking for opportunities to counterattack.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has a wide range of hard crowd control and can deal high damage with consecutive attacks. While Akali has high mobility, she is particularly strong against opponents who find it difficult to avoid Aatrox's skills. Additionally, Aatrox's passive healing ability allows for sustained combat, enabling him to endure Akali's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, first, use Aatrox's Q to maintain distance while attacking to avoid Akali's attacks. When Akali gets close, use the second Q to deal damage and utilize W to keep track of her position. Even if Akali enters her shroud, using W makes it easier to read her movements. It is also important to use E to create distance to avoid Akali's ultimate. After level 6, be cautious if Akali has Ignite and look for kill opportunities. Purchasing \"Executioner's Calling\" early as a counter item can negate Akali's healing and help turn the fight in your favor."

  "ティーモ": {
    "name": "ティーモ",
    "beats": {
      "ヴェイン": "Vayne is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect (Q) nullifies Vayne's auto attacks. Vayne is a champion that relies on auto attacks, and especially in the early game, she is easily poked down by Teemo's poison (E), making trades unfavorable. Additionally, Teemo can go invisible, increasing the risk of ambushes and potentially denying Vayne opportunities to retaliate. Furthermore, by placing mushrooms (R), Teemo can secure vision and restrict Vayne's movements, making it difficult for her to maneuver in team fights and during laning.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play passively in the early lane and manage health with Doran's Shield. To avoid Teemo's Q, farm behind minions and avoid unnecessary trades. After level 6, it is effective to use E to set up combos utilizing walls while avoiding Teemo's mushrooms. Additionally, placing wards to secure vision and track Teemo's movements is crucial. Ultimately, aim to overwhelm Teemo by leveraging item advantages.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect nullifies Camille's auto attacks, significantly reducing her damage. Teemo has a long range and can ambush while in an invisible state, making it difficult for Camille to approach. Additionally, Teemo has strong zone control capabilities and can easily restrict Camille's movements by placing mushrooms. Furthermore, Camille has low durability and struggles to maneuver in team fights, making her vulnerable to Teemo's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to stay under the tower in the lane and play safely, even if it means missing some CS. Taking W first allows you to poke and counter Teemo. Relying on the jungler to gank when Teemo is low on health can also be effective. Additionally, choosing \"Fleet Footwork\" to maintain health and using Doran's Shield and Second Wind to minimize poke is useful. Once you reach level 6, calling the jungler can create a favorable situation against Teemo.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's ranged attacks and blind effect are very troublesome for Singed. Teemo can neutralize Singed's auto-attacks with his Q from the early game and harass him. Singed is a melee champion, and when he is affected by Teemo's blind, he cannot deal damage and instead takes damage from Teemo's attacks. Additionally, Teemo can use his mushrooms (R) to secure vision and disrupt Singed's proxy farming, making it difficult for Singed to gain an experience lead.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming with Q and E without overcommitting to minions between levels 1 and 3. While being cautious of Teemo's blind, farm as safely as possible, and after reaching level 4, attempt to proxy farm effectively. It is also crucial to prioritize purchasing items with magic resistance, such as Mercury's Treads, to reduce Teemo's damage. In team fights, engaging first to disrupt the line and dealing sustained damage with E can help minimize Teemo's impact.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's ranged attacks and blind effect hinder Braum's approach. Teemo relies on auto-attacks, and before Braum can use his main skill, Q (stun), he can be neutralized by Teemo's Q (blind). Additionally, the damage from Teemo's mushrooms poses a significant obstacle when Braum attempts tower dives or engages in close combat. Furthermore, Braum has a short range, making it difficult to effectively retaliate against Teemo's poke.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. It is important to use wards and control wards to prevent Teemo's mushrooms and secure vision. Carrying a sweeper makes it easier to remove mushrooms.\n2. In the early game, utilizing Doran’s Shield and healing is crucial to endure Teemo's poke. It is necessary to play cautiously and not engage recklessly.\n3. After forcing Teemo to use his Q (blind) or when it is on cooldown, Braum should look for opportunities to approach, use E (shield), and time his retaliation with W (damage over time).\n4. After level 6, applying pressure through roaming or side lanes, and when tower diving, it is effective to check the positions of mushrooms and coordinate with allies' crowd control.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it becomes possible to mitigate Braum's disadvantages and counter Teemo.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo excels at ranged attacks, particularly by using his Q skill to nullify Jax's basic attacks. Due to Teemo's blind effect, Jax cannot rely on auto-attacks in fights, making it difficult for him to deal damage. Additionally, Teemo can go invisible, making it easier to ambush and causing Jax to lose track of when to counterattack. Furthermore, Teemo's mushrooms provide zone control, restricting Jax's movements and further highlighting his vulnerability in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to choose Fleet in runes to endure poke in lane while aiming for short trades. In terms of item build, rushing for Sheen first, followed by Mercury's Treads and Trinity Force, is advisable. During the laning phase, hiding in the bush at level 1 to secure experience and surviving until level 6 is crucial. Using the E skill to dodge Teemo's attacks while timing your attacks after he uses his Q is effective. Additionally, being aware of Teemo's mushrooms and keeping track of their locations is also important. By employing these strategies, you can alleviate the disadvantage and increase your chances of victory.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa's auto-attacks (AA) are neutralized by Teemo's blind effect. Teemo has a long range and excels at poking in the early game, allowing him to deal damage before Anbessa can get close. Additionally, Teemo's mushrooms (R) provide troublesome zone control, limiting Anbessa's approach routes and making it difficult to engage Teemo. Furthermore, while Teemo has low base durability and is vulnerable in team fights, Anbessa also has long cooldowns on his skills and is not suited for prolonged battles, often struggling to withstand Teemo's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force engagements in the early game. Instead, focus on using Q and E to farm minions and charge your passive. By being cautious of Teemo's Q (blind) and approaching from brushes or the sides, you can adjust your AA timing and avoid Teemo's attacks. When you reach level 6, use your R to create opportunities for kills and approach using minion waves to avoid mushrooms effectively. Managing vision and using control wards to eliminate Teemo's mushrooms is also crucial. This will help mitigate Teemo's strengths and allow you to engage in fights more favorably.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo can use skills with blind effects to negate Garen's auto-attacks, making it difficult for Garen to deal damage. Additionally, Teemo can go invisible and excels at ambushing, making it hard for Garen to approach. Furthermore, Teemo has strong zone control abilities and can limit Garen's movements by placing mushrooms. Although Garen has basic durability, it is challenging for him to maintain an advantage in lane due to Teemo's sustained damage and blind effects.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Wave Management**: To avoid situations where Teemo can easily manage the wave, focus on pushing the minions and aim for the timing when Teemo comes to collect CS.\n\n2. **Item Selection**: Prioritize Stridebreaker to increase movement speed and make it easier to approach Teemo. Additionally, choosing Hullbreaker can enhance durability and improve survival in side lanes.\n\n3. **Utilizing Bushes**: Enter and exit bushes to obscure Teemo's vision and avoid ambushes. Be mindful to collect CS while avoiding Teemo's attacks.\n\n4. **Level 6 Timing**: Once reaching level 6, activate Predator to create an opportunity to pressure Teemo. Use Flash Q to launch a full attack on Teemo.\n\n5. **Maintaining Mentality**: It is important to endure struggles in lane and play calmly. View the matchup against Teemo as an opportunity to learn patience and play without rushing.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, Garen can mitigate his disadvantage against Teemo and progress favorably in the lane.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect nullifies Renekton's auto attacks and skill damage. Teemo has a long range and can ambush while in an invisible state, making it difficult for Renekton to approach. Additionally, Teemo excels at using bushes to secure vision and harass while avoiding Renekton's attacks. Renekton struggles particularly at level 1, and although he becomes stronger after level 6, it becomes a tough situation if Teemo gains a farm advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to receive support from the jungler. By applying pressure early before Teemo can grow, you can suppress his development. Also, maximizing and spamming your Q makes it easier to deal damage to Teemo. Furthermore, using Exhaust can help you gain an advantage in close combat and reduce the risk of taking damage from Teemo's attacks. Finally, being mindful of bush control and denying Teemo vision can effectively reduce his harassment.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tryndamere is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect nullifies Tryndamere's auto-attacks. Teemo can poke from a distance and stop Tryndamere's AA with his Q, making it easier for him to gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, Teemo's mushrooms provide vision control and zone control, making it difficult for Tryndamere to approach. Furthermore, Tryndamere is weak against crowd control, and when Teemo engages in team fights, his low health becomes a problem.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance in the lane and avoid Teemo's Q. You need to time your E to close the gap while dodging Teemo's skills during trades. Strengthening coordination with the jungle to apply pressure on Teemo through ganks is also beneficial. After level 6, utilizing your R to create opportunities for guaranteed kills is crucial. Regarding build, choosing critical strike and lifesteal items can effectively enhance your sustained combat ability.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo has a powerful blind effect against champions that rely on auto-attacks, which can nullify Cho'Gath's attacks. Teemo excels at harassing from a distance and can safely engage while applying poison with his E. Additionally, Teemo's mushrooms (R) provide troublesome zone control, making it difficult for Cho'Gath to approach. Furthermore, Cho'Gath has low base durability and is vulnerable to Teemo's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to set runes to Grasp or shield types and choose Doran's Shield as the starting item to increase durability. In lane, it is effective to absorb Teemo's attacks with E while prioritizing CS, and to counterattack using the E→Q→W combo during trades. Additionally, managing the map and using a sweeper to remove mushrooms early can help secure vision while limiting Teemo's movements. Furthermore, considering Mercury's Treads to increase CC resistance is also beneficial.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo has a powerful blind effect against champions that rely on auto-attacks, which can nullify K'Sante's attacks. Additionally, Teemo can go invisible and excels at ambushing, making it very troublesome for short-range champions like K'Sante. Furthermore, Teemo's high zone control ability makes K'Sante susceptible to lane pressure and often leaves him in a vulnerable state during team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to first purchase a Negatron Cloak as an early item to increase magic resistance. Next, choosing Mercury's Treads can help reduce the impact of Teemo's blind effect. During the laning phase, it is crucial to avoid Teemo's blind while safely farming until level 3, and then look for opportunities to engage after level 6. Additionally, harassing with Q and maintaining distance with E can reduce the risk of taking damage from Teemo's attacks. Furthermore, selecting Second Wind or Fleet Footwork can improve sustain and increase stability in the lane.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo can use his Q, which has a blind effect, to negate Darius's auto-attacks and deal sustained damage with poison. Additionally, Teemo's mushrooms hinder Darius's approach, making it difficult for him to engage in trades. Furthermore, Teemo can become invisible, allowing him to ambush, which increases the risk of Darius taking damage. Darius is vulnerable to Teemo's ranged attacks and crowd control due to his short range and low mobility.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to control the minion wave and lure Teemo to the tower, limiting his movement. Also, clearing Teemo's mushrooms with wards or from a safe distance and purchasing boots early can increase movement speed, making it easier to approach. When reaching level 6, aiming for a full combo (E→W→Q→R) can create a favorable situation by cutting off Teemo's escape routes. Additionally, utilizing jungle intervention to apply pressure on Teemo can also be effective.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo has a long range and can use skills with a blind effect to nullify Aatrox's auto-attacks. Aatrox excels in close combat, but when he is attacked by Teemo, he cannot deal damage and instead takes continuous poison damage from Teemo. Additionally, Teemo can become invisible, making it difficult for Aatrox to time his attacks. Furthermore, Teemo is favored against tanks and skill fighters with high sustain, while Aatrox is vulnerable to such opponents.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, Aatrox is at an advantage, so it is important to level up quickly and aim for poke at levels 7-9 when the cooldown of Q becomes shorter. Buying a Doran's Shield or Second Wind can effectively reduce Teemo's damage. Additionally, it is crucial to use W effectively to dodge Teemo's attacks while timing an all-in. In team fights, Aatrox has a larger role than Teemo, so if you are losing in lane, considering roaming or participating in objectives can increase your overall impact on the game.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage. Teemo can use skills with blind effects to nullify Quinn's auto-attack-dependent damage. Additionally, Teemo's poison damage over time can be troublesome for Quinn, especially creating unfavorable situations during trades. Furthermore, Teemo has strong zone control abilities, allowing him to secure vision with mushrooms while limiting Quinn's movements. Quinn has a shorter range, and if she enters Teemo's attack range, she is likely to lose an all-in, making her particularly vulnerable in team fights, which makes it difficult for her against Teemo.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to start trades after landing Q. When Teemo is nearby, use bushes to deny his vision and look for the right moment to approach with E and land Q. In the mid-game, it is effective to bait Teemo's blind with R and attack again once it wears off. After the first kill, pushing the minions and recalling while waiting in front of the tower can help avoid Teemo's blind while still being able to attack. Additionally, building lethality and attacking the team, then gathering items before taking down Teemo is also a viable strategy. It is also important to jump out along the direction of the minions to avoid Teemo's traps.",
      "ナー": "Nautilus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo has a powerful blind effect against champions that rely on auto-attacks, which can nullify Gnar's attacks. Especially in levels 1-3, Gnar's attack power is low, and when he is blinded by Teemo's Q skill, his attacks miss, putting him at a disadvantage in trades. Additionally, Teemo's traps (R skill) provide troublesome zone control, making it difficult for Gnar to approach. Furthermore, managing Gnar's transformation is challenging, and in mini-Gnar form, his base stats are low, making it hard to all-in against Teemo.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on avoiding Teemo's attacks while farming CS in levels 1-3 and not forcing trades. After level 4, utilize the E skill to close the distance and look for opportunities to attack while avoiding Teemo's traps. In terms of item build, purchasing \"Talisman\" or \"Spirit Visage\" early can effectively reduce Teemo's damage. In team fights, participating in Mega Gnar form is crucial, aiming to catch Teemo and using the stun to coordinate with allies.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's Q (Blind) nullifies Yone's basic attacks. Teemo can attack from a distance, making it difficult for Yone to approach, especially during the laning phase where Teemo's mushrooms can zone and provide vision. Additionally, although Teemo has low base durability, if Yone tries to all-in while Teemo's Q is active, Yone's damage is significantly reduced. Furthermore, Teemo's long range makes it hard for Yone to time his auto-attacks, resulting in unfavorable trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it's important to freeze the lane and avoid stepping on Teemo's mushrooms, farming behind the minions. Next, using a sweeper or control wards to remove mushrooms and secure vision can limit Teemo's movements. Also, attacking with E after Teemo's Q has been used creates opportunities for short-term damage. In terms of items, purchasing Mercury's Treads and Bramble Vest early can effectively reduce Teemo's damage.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect significantly impacts Kail's attacks. Kail relies on auto-attacks (AA), and Teemo's Q blind nullifies that damage. Additionally, Teemo can harass effectively from the early game, leaving Kail in a very vulnerable state until she reaches level 6. Furthermore, Teemo's invisibility and mushroom zone control are also troublesome for Kail.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase \"Hearthbound Axe\" early to reduce Teemo's harassment. Maximizing the Q skill and constantly attacking with Q can minimize the impact of Teemo's blind. After level 11, Kail can win in one-on-one situations, so it is crucial to endure and aim for leveling up. Additionally, using \"Sweeper\" to eliminate Teemo's mushrooms and secure vision is also effective. In terms of item selection, buying Wit’s End as the first item and progressing with an AP build can enhance Kail's ability to counter Teemo."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect is powerful against opponents who primarily rely on auto-attacks, but Yasuo can utilize his skills to deal high DPS, making him less affected by the blind. Additionally, Yasuo can use his Wind Wall (W) to block Teemo's Q and boomerang, effectively negating Teemo's attacks. Furthermore, after level 6, Yasuo has a strong knock-up, allowing him to gain an advantage over Teemo in team fights and one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, start by securing sustain with a Doran's Shield in the early game and prioritize CS with Q through minions. After Teemo uses his Q, look for openings to land a combo of E → AA → Q, dealing damage while whittling down Teemo's health. It's also important to remove Teemo's mushrooms with Oracle or Sweeper to secure vision. After level 6, aim for your ally's knock-up and go for kills to push the game in your favor.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has skills that can ignore Teemo's blind effect, allowing him to effectively mitigate Teemo's attacks while dealing damage. Specifically, Olaf's Q and E are not affected by Teemo's blind, enabling him to consistently deal damage. Additionally, Olaf has a trait that increases his attack speed and lifesteal as his HP decreases, allowing him to engage in powerful trades even when low on health, making it easier to gain an advantage in trades against Teemo.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to wait until level 6 and then use R to pressure Teemo. Teemo finds it difficult to play aggressively against Olaf before reaching level 6, allowing Olaf to farm more effectively during that time. At levels 1 and 3, it’s good to show some respect, but when the minion wave is in the middle, it’s a good opportunity to engage. Also, be cautious if Teemo has Ignite, but generally, this is a matchup that favors Olaf. By landing Q and then following up with E, Olaf can freeze the minions to limit Teemo's actions and gain the upper hand.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high tank performance and durability in team fights, and he is resistant to Teemo's long-range poke and blind effects. Ornn can push Teemo against the wall with his E and deal damage while applying CC with his Q. Additionally, as Ornn levels up, he can upgrade his allies' items, making him a powerful presence in the late game.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, focus on farming behind the minions while avoiding Teemo's harassment, and deal damage to Teemo with the E→Q combo. After level 6, aim for an all-in with your R, restricting Teemo's movement and disrupting his mushroom placements. Also, by building armor early, you can reduce Teemo's damage and sustain in fights. In team fights, it's important to engage with your R while preventing Teemo from controlling areas with his mushrooms, coordinating with your teammates to secure victory.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon excels in short skirmishes and can utilize burst damage in the lane. By using Pantheon's E for a leap and stun, you can avoid Teemo's blind effect while quickly dealing damage. Additionally, Pantheon can actively harass Teemo between levels 1 and 3, chipping away at his health and applying kill pressure.\n\nTo take advantage, start by using the E→Q combo to harass Teemo from level 1. Be cautious of Teemo's Q blind and use your skills to avoid auto-attacks while dealing damage. It's also important to place a ward to keep track of Teemo's mushroom locations and secure vision. Once Teemo's sustain is reduced, go back to base to buy boots or HP items, then return to the lane to continue harassing. Furthermore, using your R to roam to side lanes or other lanes can influence the entire team and help secure an advantage in the match.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and AoE damage, making him skilled at engaging in team fights. Teemo is a champion that relies on auto-attacks, and he can be neutralized by Sion's skills that have blind effects, which can reduce Teemo's damage output. Additionally, although Sion's skill activation is slow, he can leverage his durability to trade favorably when taking hits from Teemo.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use **W** early to increase durability and harass Teemo with **Q**. Maximizing **Q** by level 4 and using it after hitting **E** can reduce Teemo's HP by one-third. Furthermore, using **R** to dominate the lane and continuously apply pressure on Teemo is effective. Additionally, purchasing **Ninja Tabi** and **Spectral Cowl** can help withstand Teemo's poke, allowing for sustained advantageous trades. Accurately landing skills is key to victory, so it is crucial to play carefully.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has high damage output in close combat and can engage before being affected by Teemo's blind effect. Teemo excels at harassing with ranged attacks, but Rumble can mitigate Teemo's damage while closing in by using his W to gain a shield. Additionally, Rumble can deal significant damage to Teemo by going all-in with the combo of his E and Q. Furthermore, Rumble's R deals sustained damage to enemies within its range, allowing him to clear Teemo's mushrooms from vision and gain an advantage in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, push the minions with Q while maneuvering to avoid Teemo's harassment by securing a blink dodge and shield with W. After level 3, aim for all-ins using the E and Q combo, conserving overheat as a source of damage. After level 6, use R to block off areas and lure Teemo into stepping on his mushrooms, creating advantageous situations while managing vision. It is also important to coordinate with the jungle to increase opportunities to catch Teemo.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has strong burst damage at close range and can negate Teemo's attacks with his E taunt. Additionally, by using his W, he can block Teemo's basic attacks while also having the ability to support allies with his R. Teemo's blind effect is powerful against champions that rely on auto-attacks, but Shen has means to negate auto-attacks, making him less susceptible to Teemo's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to approach from the brush in the early game, saving W to anticipate Teemo's Q. In the middle of the lane, use minions to engage with E and trade briefly when W is available. After level 6, prioritize using R for side lane interventions or team fights, and aim for a burst with E → Q → AA the moment Teemo's blind effect wears off. It's also crucial to remove Teemo's mushrooms with sweeper or control wards and to be cautious of ganks.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen can negate Teemo's blind effect. The blind that disrupts attacks relying on Teemo's auto-attacks does not affect Kennen's skill-based attacks. Additionally, Kennen can attack from a distance using Q and E, dealing damage without allowing Teemo to utilize his range. Furthermore, Kennen's R has high crowd control in team fights, allowing him to engage while dealing with the mushrooms placed by Teemo, giving him an edge in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to start the laning phase by using Q behind the minions to secure CS and avoid auto-attack trades with Teemo. After level 3, conserve E while dodging Teemo's mushrooms, aiming for the opponent's mistakes to engage briefly with Q → E → W. After level 6, have allies deal with the mushrooms, check vision, and then engage with R to maintain an advantage in team fights by either landing R first or surviving with Zhonya. Additionally, after pushing, roam to side lanes or the ally jungle to continuously apply pressure on Teemo.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has high zone control against Teemo, especially using his Q barrel to limit Teemo's movements while dealing damage. Teemo relies on auto-attacks, but Gragas's skills with blind effects can neutralize Teemo's attacks, making it easier to create favorable situations against him. Additionally, Gragas's burst damage increases as he levels up, and particularly at levels 7-9, he can take down Teemo with just two combos.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to avoid Teemo's attacks in the early game while poking with Q and ensuring you don't lose CS. Hiding in the bushes to lure Teemo out and coordinating with the jungler for a gank is also effective. When Teemo pushes the wave, prioritize leveling up and earning gold while sustaining with a D shield. Ultimately, you can leverage your strong presence in team fights to neutralize Teemo and aim for victory.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high physical defense and is particularly strong against champions that rely on auto-attacks. Teemo's blind effect nullifies auto-attack-based damage, but Malphite primarily deals damage through skills, making him less affected by the blind. Additionally, Malphite's R knock-up is very powerful for engaging in team fights, allowing him to initiate attacks while avoiding Teemo's mushrooms.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid Teemo's Q and auto-attack harassment at the start of the laning phase. Sustain with Doran’s Shield and health potions, and from levels 1 to 5, focus on farming with E while being cautious about mini-trades instead of forcing engagements. Once you reach level 6, prepare to aim for R, secure vision, and keep track of the positions of Teemo's mushrooms. If you have a champion with a blink ability on your team, it can be effective to engage with R. In team fights, you can initiate with R to neutralize Teemo while creating a favorable situation for your entire team.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high HP regeneration ability and very high durability, which gives him strong resistance against Teemo's sustained harassment and blind effects. Teemo primarily relies on auto-attacks, but Mundo can easily mitigate damage through self-healing even when affected by blind effects. Additionally, with Mundo's ultimate (R), he can gain significant healing during team fights or all-ins, allowing him to withstand Teemo's attacks and counterattack.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, it is important to avoid Teemo's harassment in the early game while farming behind minions for CS. Care should be taken not to get hit by Teemo's Q blind, and patience is required until reaching level 6. After level 6, utilize the ultimate (R) and look for the right timing to all-in Teemo. Secure vision and approach when Teemo has used his blind, using W and E to capitalize on your durability while attacking. Additionally, placing wards on mushrooms to trigger them can limit Teemo's movement and help push the lane in your favor.",
      "ライズ": "Ryze has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze is a battle mage with high DPS, capable of launching powerful attacks against Teemo using skill combos. Teemo's blind effect is effective against opponents who rely on auto-attacks, but Ryze fights using skills, making him less susceptible to the blind. Additionally, by using Ryze's snare (E), you can limit Teemo's movement and create opportunities for attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, focus on farming while avoiding Teemo's Q and managing your mana with an E→Q combo. In the mid-game, use your R to quickly close the gap and aim for an E→W→Q combo. By attacking the moment Teemo's blind wears off, you can gain the upper hand against him. It's also important to be aware of the placement of his mushrooms and secure vision to maneuver safely. After your items are completed, prioritize roaming and apply pressure in the side lanes to advance the overall game in your favor.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has high poke ability from a distance and can deal damage while avoiding Teemo's blind effect. In particular, Jayce can chip away at Teemo using his Q (Shock Blast), allowing him to reduce Teemo's HP before he gets close. Additionally, by switching to hammer form, Jayce can aim for a quick finish and exploit Teemo's low durability.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, from levels 1 to 2, be cautious of the brush while using Q to gradually chip away at Teemo. It's important to maintain distance to avoid stepping on mushrooms and not to force auto-attacks with the hammer. From levels 3 to 5, use E to accelerate, poke with Q, and once you have a health advantage, switch to hammer form and charge in. After level 6, coordinate roams and push to apply side pressure, maintaining a favorable situation against Teemo. Also, remove mushrooms with warding or sweeper, and during Teemo's blind, it's crucial to focus on skill-based attacks. Avoid unnecessary chases and be mindful of potential trap setups in the bushes.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has a long-range Q skill against Teemo, allowing him to effectively trade while avoiding Teemo's sustained poke. Additionally, Teemo's blind effect is powerful against champions that rely on auto-attacks, but Gangplank fights using skills, making him less affected by the blind. Furthermore, Gangplank can cleanse CC and heal with his W skill, giving him high survivability in lane and allowing him to withstand Teemo's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, first, at level 1, hide behind the minions to farm while avoiding Teemo's attacks. Once you reach level 2, you can use your Q skill to initiate trades against Teemo. By predicting Teemo's position and approaching, you also have a chance to win trades at level 1. Additionally, in the mid-game, effectively placing barrels and aiming for combos during fights with enemy champions can help you gain an advantage over Teemo. It's also important to manage your mana and avoid overusing your Q skill.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has high healing and sustained damage in the mid to late game, making it easier to negate Teemo's blind effect. Teemo primarily relies on auto-attacks, but Bloodmire has sustain from his Q and can avoid Teemo's attacks by using his W. Additionally, Teemo's skills are mainly strong in the early game, while Bloodmire has a powerful ultimate after level 6, allowing him to perform well in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, pay attention to Teemo's ranged attacks while prioritizing CS with Q for farming. Be cautious of Teemo's blind and use W to dodge important damage or skills to reduce reliance on auto-attacks. Once you reach level 6, safely avoid damage with W while aiming to engage Teemo with a combo of E and R. It's also important to be aware of mushrooms and vision, using wards to safely roam or move to the side. As for items, preparing magic resistance early and aiming for healing enhancement can help you gain an advantage against Teemo.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is not significantly affected by Teemo's blind effect. Teemo's blind is powerful against champions that rely heavily on auto-attacks, but Mordekaiser can deal damage using his skills, making it easier to negate Teemo's attacks. Additionally, Mordekaiser has a shield, excels at lane sustain, and can deal consistent damage, making him strong in long trades.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to farm safely in the early game and avoid Teemo's attacks. Play calmly until level 6, equipping a Doran's Shield and Second Wind to withstand Teemo's poke. After level 6, the chances to take down Teemo increase significantly when using your ultimate, so after purchasing Rylai's, you can actively pressure Teemo. Continuing to farm without taking damage from Teemo and aiming to snowball is crucial.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is a melee champion with burst damage, allowing her to effectively utilize Teemo's blind effect while aiming for a quick finish. In particular, by using Irelia's Q to kill minions and reset, she can easily engage Teemo. Additionally, with the damage reduction from her W, she can mitigate the damage from Teemo's poke and blind while being able to counterattack.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early lane phase, avoid Teemo's poke with his Q while using minions to reset Q and engage in short trades. It is important to refrain from auto-attacking while Teemo is using his blind and to reduce damage taken with W. After level 6, you can dive in using R, aim for a stun with E, and chase with Q to secure kills. Also, to avoid Teemo's mushrooms, it is crucial to maintain vision and be aware of where the mushrooms are placed. As for items, building MR early to counter Teemo's magic damage and purchasing Tiamat or Trinity items to increase damage is effective.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high single-target dueling power in close combat, especially as she can use her R to negate Teemo's mushrooms and blind effects while dealing damage. Additionally, by using her W, she can block Teemo's auto-attacks and Q, allowing her to mitigate harassment while counterattacking. Furthermore, Fiora has high healing capabilities, making her more likely to maintain an advantage in sustained fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game, prioritize CS behind the minions and maneuver to avoid Teemo's harassment. Between levels 2 and 5, conserve your W and engage in short trades while parrying Teemo's auto-attacks and Q. After level 6, it is important to use your R to aim for a burst against Teemo while using W to block blinds and auto-attacks, and targeting key areas with R. Additionally, utilizing wards and sweepers to clear mushrooms in advance and secure vision is crucial. This way, Fiora can create a favorable situation against Teemo."

  "ヤスオ": {
    "name": "ヤスオ",
    "beats": {
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and strong DPS, which allows him to play favorably against champions with short range like Gwen. With Yasuo's E for closing in and his R that has a knock-up, Gwen is likely to take significant damage if caught. Additionally, since all of Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, he can deal sustained damage easily, often putting Gwen at a disadvantage even in short trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, equipping Bone Plating can effectively reduce Yasuo's early damage. Also, predicting Yasuo's E usage and understanding his dash destination can make it easier to land Q. Furthermore, since Gwen excels at pushing side lanes, it is crucial to avoid 1v1s with Yasuo and participate in objective fights to contribute to the team as a whole. This way, you can avoid direct confrontations with Yasuo while progressing the game in your favor.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo is very powerful in mid to late team fights, especially because he can block Teemo's attacks with his Wind Wall (W). Teemo is strong in the early game, but as Yasuo levels up, he can approach while dodging Teemo's poke (E/Q) and deal damage, making Teemo struggle in the late game. Additionally, Yasuo has a knock-up (Q), which can limit Teemo's movement, causing Teemo to become significantly weaker if caught.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, in the early lane, it is important to harass from behind minions with E/Q while maintaining distance and managing the wave effectively. By being cautious of Yasuo's Q stacks and E dash, and keeping the minion wave on your side, you can prevent Yasuo from approaching. After level 6, be aware of Yasuo's ultimate combo, and it’s advisable to poke after provoking his Wind Wall. Also, place mushrooms (R) in escape routes and side entrances to control the area in team fights. During engagements, if Yasuo relies on his Wind Wall, it’s important not to force trades and instead escape to the jungle or sides. Summoners can weaken Yasuo's damage by taking Exhaust, and for item builds, choosing Nashor's Tooth or Liandry's AP build would be beneficial.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and the ability to deal continuous damage, making him particularly strong in short trades. Yasuo can close the gap with his E, deal damage with his Q, and then use Wind Wall to block Mundo's counterattack. Additionally, Yasuo has a passive that increases his critical strike chance, allowing him to deal sustained damage that can surpass Mundo's healing capabilities. Furthermore, Mundo lacks crowd control, and if he gets knocked up by Yasuo, he can quickly find himself in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force engagements in the early lane phase, but rather to farm minions with Q while maintaining a health advantage. Be cautious of Yasuo's E+Q combo and position yourself to avoid his engage. When Yasuo attacks, it is crucial to use the movement speed from W to create distance. In team fights, standing at the front to protect allies, saving R to heal after Yasuo's burst, and looking for the right moment to counterattack can be effective. Additionally, being aware of objectives and contributing to the team can help steer the overall flow of the game in your favor.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has strong damage from the early game, particularly being able to gain an advantage in trades starting from level 1. While Irelia becomes stronger after level 2/3, Yasuo's high mobility and Wind Wall (W) make it likely that Irelia's R can be negated. Additionally, Yasuo's knock-up (E) can temporarily disable Irelia, causing her to lose opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, Yasuo has a passive that increases his critical strike chance, which also puts Irelia at a disadvantage in terms of sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to play cautiously until level 3 and manage HP effectively. By looking for trades when Yasuo's Q3 is unavailable, you can increase your chances of dealing damage. Additionally, purchasing Plated Steelcaps can reduce Yasuo's damage, and having a Vampiric Scepter can provide sustained healing. Furthermore, when using E, creatively avoiding the Wind Wall and using R after provoking the Wind Wall post-level 6 can allow for effective damage dealing. It is crucial to play safely, keep the wave on your side, facilitate healing, and remain aware of potential ganks from the jungler.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and shields, making him particularly strong against opponents with skill shots. Urgot has a short range and long cooldowns on his skills, making him susceptible to Yasuo's attacks. Additionally, Yasuo's Wind Wall often blocks Urgot's attacks, and especially Urgot's R becomes less effective if he doesn't reduce HP beforehand. Furthermore, Yasuo can engage and disengage with his E, making it difficult for Urgot to time his attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the first effective step is to purchase Ninja Tabi. This will reduce damage from Yasuo's basic attacks. It is also important to avoid attacks when Yasuo can freely dash during times when there are many minions. If Yasuo is taking a lot of damage, he is more likely to use Wind Wall, so it may be worth considering attacking during that window. Below level 9, Urgot's chances of a solo kill are low, so it is necessary to play cautiously without forcing attacks.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and the ability to deal continuous damage, especially by utilizing knock-ups to aim for significant damage. While K'Sante has high durability, he can be quickly whittled down by Yasuo's attacks even with a shield. Additionally, Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, making it easy to deal sustained damage and often allowing him to engage before K'Sante can activate his defensive skills. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range, making it difficult to avoid Yasuo's skill shots, which can lead to unfavorable trades in lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:\n1. In the early lane phase, avoid unnecessary fights and play cautiously while checking Yasuo's Q stacks and shield.\n2. Look for opportunities to engage when Yasuo's shield is down. It is particularly effective to exploit openings after Yasuo has used his skills.\n3. Quickly build armor-oriented items to increase durability and prolong the fight.\n4. Be aware of jungle interventions and coordinate with allies while being cautious of Yasuo's knock-ups.\n5. In team fights, isolate Yasuo and use strategies to keep him restrained for an extended period to reduce his healing.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and a shield, which allows him to effectively dodge Rumble's attacks, especially by using his W to block skill shots. Additionally, Yasuo can easily close the gap with his E and deal high damage by targeting the second part of his Q (Tornado). Furthermore, all of Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, making it easier for him to deal sustained damage and creating a situation where Rumble struggles to manage his heat. Rumble only has a slow as crowd control, which limits his options to counter Yasuo's mobility, putting him at a particularly disadvantageous position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in lane, deal sustained damage with Q from behind the minions to provoke Yasuo's E. Next, after applying a slow with E, hitting him with Q can help suppress Yasuo's counterattacks. Additionally, save W for dodging approaches and look for the right moment to use the shield to counterattack when Yasuo engages. Moreover, placing R in bushes or behind walls to block Yasuo's escape routes is crucial for increasing control in team fights.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo's high mobility and Wind Wall (W) hinder Pantheon's attacks. In particular, Yasuo can approach or escape with his E blink, making it easy to avoid Pantheon's all-in (W stun → E → Q). Additionally, Yasuo scales well in the mid-game and has a high ability to deal sustained damage, so if Pantheon cannot maintain an early advantage, there is a risk of being outscaled later. Furthermore, Yasuo has crowd control (CC), which means Pantheon could get caught when trying to gank.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to start with Doran's Shield to increase durability in the early game. It is crucial not to forcefully go through Yasuo's Wind Wall (W) and to time skill usage carefully. When trying to catch Yasuo off guard with E, doing so over minions can help avoid his counterattack. Additionally, after level 6, utilizing roams to apply pressure on other lanes can effectively increase pressure on Yasuo. In team fights, being aware of your allies' ranged abilities and positioning to block Yasuo's E can help turn the battle in your favor.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and burst damage, and can particularly use Wind Wall to block Yorick's ranged attacks. Since Yorick relies on his pets, if Yasuo uses a blink to close the gap and quickly takes out the pets, Yorick's combat ability significantly decreases. Additionally, if Yasuo lands a combo utilizing his knock-up, Yorick is at risk of taking a lot of damage all at once. Furthermore, Yorick has weak crowd control in team fights and is vulnerable to AoE attacks, making him prone to unfavorable situations even in one-on-one encounters with Yasuo.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on farming in the early lane and consciously use Wind Wall to avoid Yasuo's attacks. Additionally, leveling up Ghost and Maiden can help zone the opponent, creating a situation where Yasuo finds it difficult to approach. After level 6, it is crucial to use R to restrain and time the full combo effectively. Moreover, strengthening coordination with the jungle and creating situations that make it easier to call for ganks can increase the means to counter Yasuo.",
      "アカリ": "Akali is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and shields, particularly excelling at avoiding skill shots. Akali's attacks are primarily melee, and Yasuo can easily close the distance with his Q and E dashes, making her susceptible to counterattacks. Additionally, Yasuo's ultimate negates Akali's stealth, making it difficult for her to create advantageous situations. Furthermore, Yasuo is strong against tank champions with crowd control, which can render Akali's short trades ineffective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, it is crucial to time when to stack Yasuo's Q and avoid standing near minions. Also, by using E to dodge Yasuo's dashes, you can avoid attacks while creating opportunities for counterattacks. Focusing on short trades and attacking while avoiding Yasuo's skills can help leverage Akali's strengths. In terms of item selection, bringing a Dark Seal or a red potion for early sustain can also be effective.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and a wind wall, which can block Jayce's ranged attacks. In particular, Yasuo can close the gap with his E and stack his Q, allowing for a powerful counterattack against Jayce. Additionally, Yasuo can use all of his skills at no cost, making it easier for him to deal sustained damage and giving him resistance against Jayce's burst damage. Furthermore, while Yasuo struggles against tank champions with crowd control, Jayce does not possess such traits, making it a favorable matchup for Yasuo.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. It is important to be aware of the wind wall and maintain distance while harassing to avoid Yasuo's attacks. Especially when using Q's Shock Blast, timing should be considered in relation to Yasuo's wind wall.\n2. Utilizing minions to absorb Yasuo's attacks and using E to place gates can effectively slow him down and prevent his approach.\n3. After level 6, being mindful of roaming and vision can allow for support from other lanes or the jungle, applying pressure on Yasuo. In particular, in team fights, it is crucial to leverage Jayce's burst damage to eliminate Yasuo early.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and shields, and especially the damage after using his Q (Steel Tempest) is very high. Quinn has a shorter range and is susceptible to Yasuo's attacks, particularly since his W (Wind Wall) can block Quinn's attacks unless it's on cooldown. Additionally, Yasuo can use his E (Sweeping Blade) to dash through minions and close the gap, making it difficult for Quinn to maintain distance. Furthermore, Yasuo has crowd control, which increases the risk of Quinn getting caught when she tries to engage.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to avoid Yasuo's Q (Steel Tempest). Specifically, dodging Q3 can negate his damage. It is also a good idea to initiate with an auto-attack to trigger Yasuo's W (Wind Wall) and activate his passive. After Yasuo uses Q3, you can look for opportunities to attack while his W is on cooldown. Additionally, equipping Bone Plating can improve survivability, and it is crucial to fight while maintaining space in a one-on-one against Yasuo. This will reduce the risk of taking Yasuo's attacks and increase the chances of victory.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and DPS, excelling particularly in his ability to deal sustained damage in lane. Yasuo's Q allows for consecutive attacks, and his E provides powerful engage and disengage, making the situation especially difficult for Kail before she reaches level 6. Additionally, Yasuo's Wind Wall can block Kail's attacks, reducing her opportunities to strike. Furthermore, Kail is very weak in the early game, and taking damage from Yasuo can quickly put her in a disadvantageous position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, purchasing a \"Static Shiv\" as a first item can be effective, making it easier to deal damage while Yasuo is in the minion wave. In lane, it's important to aim for last hits while not overextending and pulling back when necessary. Timing attacks when Yasuo's Wind Wall is down and receiving jungle support can also increase the chances of countering Yasuo. Additionally, buying anti-heal items can help suppress Yasuo's healing, allowing for a more favorable position in the later stages of the game.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and shields, making him very strong against opponents who rely on skill shots. Ornn's Q can be blocked by Yasuo's Wind Wall, making it difficult to deal damage. Additionally, Yasuo can engage and disengage with his E, making it easier to avoid Ornn's attacks, and Ornn has many skills that require preparation to apply crowd control, which works against him. Furthermore, Yasuo has a passive that increases his critical strike chance, allowing him to deal high DPS against Ornn's low defensive stats.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to attack when Yasuo's ultimate is on cooldown. Additionally, poking Yasuo while he is moving in and out among minions to break his shield is a good strategy. Utilizing a level 3 combo (Q, E, W, AA) can also help to trade favorably. Furthermore, consider using W to avoid knock-ups and dodge Yasuo's tornado.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas's skill activation is slow, especially the charge time of his Q, making it difficult to limit Yasuo's high mobility and continuous damage output. Additionally, Yasuo can negate Gragas's Q with his Wind Wall, effectively shutting down Gragas's main means of attack. Furthermore, while Gragas can counter Yasuo's approach with his E and knockback against Yasuo's ultimate combo from W, timing the interruption of Yasuo's ultimate is challenging, increasing the risk of being caught instead.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to aim to hit Q when Yasuo's Wind Wall is down. Additionally, using E to close the gap and trading while healing with W allows for sustained fighting. After level 6, it is crucial to conserve R while timing the interruption of Yasuo's ultimate. Moreover, focusing on health and magic resistance in item builds can enhance survivability, allowing for a more favorable matchup against Yasuo."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum has high damage in close combat during the early to mid-game, and can especially gain the upper hand in a fight against Yasuo. Braum's passive increases his attack speed, allowing for consecutive attacks, making it easier to deal damage while ignoring Yasuo's shield and mobility. Additionally, Braum's W provides a re-engage and a stun effect that prevents Yasuo from approaching or escaping with his E, leaving no opportunity for Yasuo to counterattack.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (levels 1-6), use Q and engage in short trades in front of the minions to create a health advantage. While using W to re-engage, manage your health to avoid taking too much burst damage from Yasuo's E→Q combo. After level 6, use R to initiate attacks, and if your allies provide CC or support, it becomes easier to secure kills. When alone, be cautious of Yasuo's Wind Wall while using R to engage, and look for the right timing to deal damage.\n\nIn the mid-game, it is important to act as an initiator and prioritize shutting down Yasuo's ultimate to create fragmented fights. In the late game, while being mindful of Yasuo's critical hits and multi-hit damage, you need to endure as a frontline and eliminate threats with R.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven has high burst damage and excels at maximizing damage using her skills. Against Yasuo, Riven can leverage her CC (stun) to trade favorably. Additionally, Riven can attack while moving, making it easier to dodge Yasuo's Wind (W) and difficult for him to block her attacks. Furthermore, Riven has no skill costs, allowing her to sustain her attacks more easily.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, focus on hitting minions with Q to accumulate hits, and trade safely without forcing engagements. Maintain distance with E while executing short trades with the W→Q×3 combo to force Yasuo to use his skills. Once you reach level 6, apply kill pressure with your ultimate while avoiding the enemy's CC. In front of the tower, use W (shield) to withstand Yasuo's skills, and prioritize diving onto high-value carries in team fights to maximize Riven's strengths.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he scales infinitely in damage by stacking his Q, making him very powerful in the late game. Yasuo has high mobility and DPS, but Nasus can limit Yasuo's attacks with his W's slow and attack speed reduction. Additionally, Nasus can build tanky, giving him high durability, which makes it easier for him to survive in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to safely stack Q from the start. Avoid trading with Yasuo, and either use W to escape or utilize the slow to maintain distance. In lane, save E for zoning and don't forget to take care of the jungle. From mid to late game, freeze or slow push under the tower to increase Q stacks while aiming for a split push. In team fights, it is crucial not to overextend and to leverage Nasus's strength to contribute to the team.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire can deal sustained damage to Yasuo more easily, especially by utilizing the invulnerability effect of his W to avoid Yasuo's knock-up. While Yasuo has high burst potential in short trades, Bloodmire has sustain from his Q, allowing him to gain the upper hand in extended fights. Additionally, since Yasuo's attacks rely on skill shots, using Bloodmire's W makes it easier to negate those attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, start with Corrupting Potion or Doran's Ring + Potion to secure sustain. From levels 1 to 5, avoid short trades, farm minions with Q while healing, and pay attention to Yasuo's E→Q combo. Save W to dodge Yasuo's knock-up, and after level 6, use R's Hemoplague to gain an advantage in team fights. In terms of items, transitioning from Corrupting Potion to Rylai's and then choosing Zhonya's or magic resistance will increase durability against Yasuo and aim for an advantage in extended fights.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage and can maneuver advantageously in a long fight while taking Yasuo's attacks. Although Yasuo has high burst damage, Singed can easily limit Yasuo's mobility by utilizing his sustained damage, slows, and crowd control. Additionally, since Singed lacks ranged attacks, it can be difficult to prevent Yasuo from closing the gap, but by continuously dealing damage with Singed's Q and securing an escape route with W, he can dodge Yasuo's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, avoid attacking recklessly and be cautious of Yasuo's Q combo. Block direct throws of E with minions and prevent Yasuo's positioning with his E. Deal continuous damage with Q, create an escape route with W, and capitalize on the opportunity to deal damage when Yasuo uses Wind Wall by pulling Q. After level 6, be wary of Yasuo's R after he uses his knock-up, and retaliate with your own R and fling. It's important to gain vision through roaming and proxying, and in team fights, use R at the frontline to absorb damage, making it easier for your allies in the backline to deal damage. Always be aware of the presence of Wind Wall and prioritize the positioning of fling to maximize Singed's advantage.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has strong single-target pressure and true damage, allowing her to deal high burst damage to Yasuo. In particular, Camille's W deals true damage, which can bypass Yasuo's shield and inflict damage, effectively negating Yasuo's defenses. Additionally, Camille has a long-range blink, making it easier to avoid Yasuo's E for engagement, thus creating favorable situations for Camille.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it's important to use Q and auto-attacks with short trades to accumulate damage while avoiding prolonged skirmishes with Yasuo. After level 6, using E to take the wall and R to isolate Yasuo, followed by W's true damage to chip away at his health, is effective. Also, pay attention to minion positioning; when Yasuo approaches via minions with his E, you can bait him into using his wind wall early to avoid the knock-up. Furthermore, during jungle interventions, using R to isolate Yasuo will create advantageous situations for dealing with him.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton has high sustain and powerful combos, allowing him to gain an edge over Yasuo, especially after level 3. Renekton's W can break Yasuo's passive shield, enabling favorable trades with a short cooldown. Additionally, Renekton can enhance his skills using Fury, allowing him to deal sustained damage while healing, making it easier to withstand Yasuo's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on farming minions from level 1 while avoiding Yasuo's Q. Refrain from trading until level 2 and continue to control the wave. Once you reach level 3 and are in good health, start trading while keeping your Fury above 50 to break Yasuo's shield with enhanced W. When Yasuo approaches, close the gap with E and attack using enhanced W. During trades, it's important to consider Yasuo's Q cooldown and play calmly while executing short trades.\n\nIn this way, Renekton can gain an advantage over Yasuo by playing correctly, leading to a higher chance of victory.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has a high ability to deal sustained damage against Yasuo, especially excelling in an AA (auto-attack) reliant playstyle. Yasuo relies heavily on skill shots, so Jax can negate auto-attacks with his W, making it easier to block Yasuo's attacks. Additionally, as Jax levels up, he gains a powerful attack speed buff, allowing him to unleash overwhelming DPS against Yasuo in the late game.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, it's important to play cautiously before the first recall, as Yasuo is strong during this time, and to be aware of power spikes. Playing passively until the first recall and securing a sheen will allow Jax to capitalize on his strengths. It's effective to save E to dodge Yasuo's Q and use dashes to engage. Also, it's crucial to engage in short trades to prevent Yasuo from stacking runes. When Yasuo has no targets to dash to, attacking aggressively and using E defensively can maximize Jax's advantage.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has a W (Riposte) that can parry Yasuo's CC, allowing her to effectively negate Yasuo's attacks and, in turn, apply a stun. Additionally, Fiora can deal powerful percentage damage to tank champions, making it easier to counter Yasuo's shields and high DPS. Furthermore, Fiora excels in one-on-one situations, giving her an edge in 1v1 scenarios.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important not to force fights in the early game and to safely chip away at vitals with Q. Timing the parry with W when Yasuo attempts to use Q3 (Tornado) or E→R for follow-up is key. After a successful W, you can immediately finish the fight with a combo (Q→AA→R). Also, be mindful of minion clusters and the jungler's position to avoid being caught by Yasuo's E. In terms of item selection, prioritize lifesteal and durability, choosing items like Hydra or Death's Dance to enhance sustained combat ability.",
      "セト": "Set is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Set has sustained HP recovery abilities and a strong shield, allowing him to withstand Yasuo's attacks. Additionally, Set can use his E to stun and catch Yasuo, making it easier to force trades. Since Yasuo relies on skill shots, using Set's W to shield can reduce damage while providing an opportunity for counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, first choose \"Second Wind\" and \"Doran's Shield\" to endure poke. Use the minion wave to approach Yasuo, aiming for a stun with E while dealing damage with Q. It's also important to learn the timing to bait Yasuo's Q and dodge it. Furthermore, being aware of Yasuo's turret and your own position allows you to effectively deal damage with an AA-Q combo. Additionally, rushing to buy Steelcaps can reduce Yasuo's damage and allow you to play more advantageously.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has a dash attached to all of his skills, making it easier to avoid Yasuo's attacks with his high mobility. In particular, by engaging after provoking Yasuo's Wind Wall, Anbessa can deal damage while preventing Yasuo's counterattack. Additionally, Anbessa's W provides a shield and explosive damage, which can mitigate Yasuo's burst damage from his Q, allowing for advantageous short trades.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game, provoke Yasuo's Wind Wall with Q, then use E to close the gap and perform short trades with passive auto-attacks. In the mid-game and beyond, reduce incoming damage with W while utilizing E's slow to chase, aiming to suppress Yasuo when his Wind Wall is down with R. In team fights, it is crucial to target the enemy carry with R and to fight tenaciously using E and passive.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing capabilities against Yasuo, and particularly with his Q skill that silences, he can prevent Yasuo from using his abilities. Yasuo is a champion that relies heavily on skill shots, and when his attacks are nullified by silence, it significantly reduces his damage output. Additionally, Garen's ultimate skill deals true damage, allowing him to bypass Yasuo's shields and deal damage, making him very powerful in one-on-one combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it is effective to use the \"cheese\" strategy by attacking after triggering Yasuo's passive at level 2. This allows you to strip Yasuo of his shield while gaining an advantage in trades. It is also important to limit Yasuo's dashes by fighting away from minions and to be clever with your positioning. After gathering items, look for an opportunity to use Ignite when Yasuo's passive shield is down to take him down quickly. While focusing on short trades, it is also crucial to farm safely.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has powerful sustained damage in close combat, especially excelling in trades at levels 2 and 6. Darius's passive skill, which causes bleeding, can deal damage to Yasuo over a long period, and by using Darius's E to pull Yasuo in, he can force close combat. Additionally, Darius's R can be reused after getting a kill when used at 5 stacks, making it easier to aim for multi-kills in team fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first manage the minions from level 1 and aim for the E→Q→AA combo at level 2. By pulling Yasuo with E and counterattacking, you can deal damage while engaging in favorable trades. During trades, it is important to stack Hemorrhage with Q and secure healing with W while aiming for a quick resolution. When reaching level 6, make sure to use R at 5 stacks to deal powerful damage to Yasuo. Since Yasuo's Wind Wall only blocks projectiles, Darius can continue attacking without worrying about it.\n\nIn this way, Darius has many advantageous elements against Yasuo, particularly leveraging his sustained damage and strength in trades in close combat to aim for victory.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration and an ultimate that makes him invincible for 5 seconds, making him very strong in one-on-one fights and tower dives. Yasuo has high mobility, but by using Tremendous's ultimate, he can negate Yasuo's attacks and deal sustained damage. Additionally, since Tremendous relies on auto-attacks, he can easily deal consistent damage by avoiding Yasuo's wind wall and knock-up.\n\nTo take advantage, first, stack Q with minions to maintain lane control and thoroughly sidestep to avoid Yasuo's E and Q. By checking the cooldowns of Yasuo's wind wall and knock-up, and using the ultimate at the right timing, it is possible to negate Yasuo's attacks while counterattacking. Furthermore, jungle intervention can determine the outcome, so it is also important to use wards to secure vision and keep track of the opponent's movements.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses high mobility and DPS against Yasuo, particularly because Yasuo's defensive skills are less effective. Yasuo's attacks mainly rely on skill shots, so by using Yone's E to engage or disengage, it becomes easier to avoid Yasuo's attacks. Additionally, Yone's W is effective at breaking Yasuo's shield, which helps suppress Yasuo's counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to play carefully in the early game to avoid Yasuo's powerful attacks. Starting with a Doran's Shield increases sustainability, making it easier to maintain the lane. Using E to dodge Yasuo's Q3 and mitigating damage with W while counterattacking is effective. In the mid-game, gathering items and hitting a power spike allows you to gain an advantage over Yasuo."

      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Sett's strength in close combat and his sustained sustain. Sett has a shield from his W and high HP regeneration, making him strong in prolonged fights. Additionally, if Sett interrupts Irelia's engage with his E, Irelia loses her opportunity to attack and becomes more susceptible to counterattacks from Sett. Furthermore, Sett can catch Irelia with his stun ability, and since Irelia's escape potential is limited, she can find herself in a tough situation when hit by crowd control.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on resetting Q with minions in the early game and prioritize CS. Avoid unnecessary 1v1s, check Sett's W and R cooldowns, and look for opportunities to engage after these skills have been used. Additionally, by using E to dodge Sett's attacks while dealing burst damage with Q, you can make trades more favorable. After level 6, use R to manipulate the lane and secure vision while joining fights from the side to increase your impact in team fights.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Sett's powerful melee attacks and CC skills. Sett has strong damage from the early game and can catch Yasuo with true damage from his W and a stun from his E. Yasuo has low base stats and is particularly vulnerable to CC, so getting stunned by Sett's E can quickly put him in a disadvantageous situation. Additionally, Sett's sustained HP recovery and shields allow him to capitalize on long fights. Furthermore, Yasuo's W is less effective against Sett's melee attacks, making it difficult to block Sett's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance behind minions in the early game while harassing with E+Q and avoiding Sett's attacks. Also, focus on short trades and be mindful of spamming auto-attacks to avoid Sett's W. After level 6, it is effective to use allies' knock-ups or terrain to create a knock-up with E→Q and aim for R. In terms of items, prioritize penetration and lifesteal, and choose tankier items (like Ninja Tabi or Mercury's Treads) as needed to counter CC.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett is very strong in early skirmishes, particularly due to his W's true damage, which allows him to gain an advantage over Yone. Sett has high durability and is strong in prolonged fights thanks to his sustained HP recovery and shields. Additionally, Sett's E provides him with a way to close the gap, making it difficult for Yone to maintain distance and easily losing the advantage in trades. Furthermore, Yone is highly reliant on items, and until he is properly equipped, he tends to struggle in lane, which exacerbates his disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary engagements in the early lane phase, attacking from skill range with Q while taking CS and harassing. After provoking Sett's W, Yone can safely engage in trades to gain an advantage. Additionally, by being cautious of Sett's E, Yone can either sidestep with E or avoid it with Wind Slash to prevent Sett from closing in. After level 6, by observing the situation in the side lanes and jungle, Yone can effectively use his R to create opportunities to gain an advantage over Sett by aiming for splits.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett is a very powerful fighter in close combat, and his sustain from W and burst damage in a short time pose a threat to Urgot. Sett can close the gap with E, deal damage with auto-attacks and Q, while increasing his durability with the shield from W. Although Urgot tries to harass from a distance, once Sett gets close, Urgot's skill activation is slow, making it difficult to counterattack. Additionally, receiving Sett's full combo from R can significantly reduce Urgot's health.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early stages of laning, try to bait Sett's E and W before counterattacking, and avoid engaging recklessly. In terms of item build, focus on durability and purchase penetration items like Black Cleaver early to increase damage against Sett. Furthermore, in team fights, using R from the frontline to eliminate key targets and dealing damage before Sett can approach is effective. It is also important to use Flash to secure an escape route and avoid Sett's attacks.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett is very strong in close combat, especially because he can deal high damage with combos using his Q and E. Sett has a shield with his W and possesses sustained HP recovery, making it easier for him to leverage his advantage in prolonged fights. Additionally, when Cho'Gath is hit by Sett's CC skill, the stun, he loses the opportunity to counterattack, and especially after level 6, Sett's powerful attacks using his R become a significant threat. Furthermore, Cho'Gath should avoid close combat, but Sett's engage tools are strong, making it easy for Cho'Gath to find himself in difficult situations where escaping is challenging.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to utilize long-range poke (E + Q) in the early lane phase to chip away at Sett's health. It is also crucial to conserve W (Silence) and time it to disrupt Sett's engage or important skills. Additionally, pushing the lane to aim for plates or kills with Feast and building a tankier build (HP + MR/AR) to increase durability can be effective. After level 6, it is necessary to aim for kills with R and play a role in maintaining the frontline during team fights while supporting the team.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Sett's high durability and sustained damage. Sett has true damage from his W and is strong in short trades, making Fiora susceptible to taking significant damage when she tries to engage. Additionally, Sett's E pull and R positioning can restrict Fiora's movements, making it difficult for her to retaliate with CC from her W. Furthermore, Fiora lacks AoE attacks, making it challenging to manage minion waves and create favorable situations against Sett.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it's important to poke Sett to force him to waste his W while managing minions, creating opportunities for 1v1 trades. After confirming Sett's E and R, using W to stun can create a chance for a counterattack. Additionally, utilizing Fiora's ultimate to initiate short skirmishes can be effective. It is crucial to maintain distance to bait Sett's skills while timing attacks carefully.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett is very powerful in close-range skirmishes, especially able to engage from level 2 to 3. By closing in with Sett's Q and dealing significant damage with his W, Yorick can take damage early on. Additionally, Sett can ignore Yorick's summoned Mist Walkers and attack directly, making it difficult for Yorick's pets to function effectively in combat. Furthermore, if Yorick is hit by Sett's CC skill, the stun, he often loses the opportunity to retaliate, especially in team fights, putting him at a disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to freeze the minion wave in lane and farm safely. To avoid Sett's engages, marking the enemy with E and trading while healing with Q can be effective. Also, using W to block Sett's charge can help reduce damage. After level 6, saving R for team fights or isolating situations can allow Yorick to leverage his strengths.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett is strong in short trades, especially because he can deal burst damage that negates Shen's W (Spirit's Refuge). After pulling Shen in with his E, Sett can aim for high damage with his W punches and R, making it difficult for Shen to survive that moment. Additionally, Shen has limited mobility options, making it hard to avoid Sett's attacks, especially in the early lane phase where he is more susceptible to Sett's damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance in the early laning phase and avoid prolonged trades with Sett. Timing a counterattack with an empowered Q when Sett's W is on cooldown from his normal attacks can be effective. Also, when Sett tries to pull you in with his E, countering with E (Taunt) or using the positioning of minions to dodge can be useful. After level 6, prioritizing support for allies with your R and focusing on contributing in team fights can help leverage Shen's strengths.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reasons for this are Set's high sustain and high damage output from his short combos. Set can easily create an advantage in short skirmishes using his Q and W, especially by utilizing his E to catch Gwen when she tries to approach. Additionally, Set's shield from his W reduces Gwen's damage, allowing him to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Gwen has a short range, making it difficult for her to avoid Set's attacks and susceptible to harassment.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use Q behind minions for last hits in the early game while avoiding close combat with Set. You can evade Set's charges with E and retreat under the tower when your health is low to ensure safety. Moreover, in the mid-game and beyond, utilizing your R to stop Set's ultimate and charges, and coordinating with allies to counterattack can be effective. Focus on dealing sustained damage while maintaining distance, and aim for key carries in team fights.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett's short-term one-combo is extremely powerful, especially between levels 1 and 3, where there is a high chance of being significantly damaged by Sett's E→W combo. Sett has excellent skills for brawling, and particularly his W's center hit deals true damage with high damage output. Furthermore, Sett excels at closing the distance against Mundo, who has limited mobility options, allowing him to deal significant damage before Mundo can retaliate. Additionally, Sett's ultimate (R) deals damage based on maximum health, which is painful, and since it is difficult for Mundo to drastically increase his HP, he tends to find himself in a disadvantageous situation against Sett.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance while farming CS in the early lane phase and to make Sett miss his E. Use Q (axe) to farm minions while conserving potions for healing. After level 6, utilize Mundo's R for continuous healing and prolong the fight to turn the situation in your favor. Also, purchasing Bramble Vest as a first item can reduce Sett's damage, and equipping tank items can enhance durability. In team fights, it is crucial to act as a frontliner, being cautious of Sett's target acquisition while focusing on protecting allies.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett is strong in close combat, particularly able to absorb Garen's attacks with his W's shield and damage. Garen struggles in long trades and finds it difficult to counter Sett's sustained damage and healing abilities. Additionally, if Garen is hit by Sett's CC skill, the stun, he loses the opportunity to retaliate and falls into an even worse situation. Furthermore, Sett has an ultimate that serves as a means of closing the gap, allowing him to play a powerful role in team fights, making it difficult for Garen to re-engage once he has been peeled.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Sett's W. Since the cooldown of W is long, timing your attacks can allow you to gain an advantage. Also, focusing on short trades and using E to close the gap on Sett, then escaping with Q after forcing him to use W is an effective strategy. In terms of item build, starting with Sunfire can increase your durability and make it easier to absorb Sett's attacks. Additionally, attacking when Sett is at low HP can create opportunities to finish him off with a combo of Q, Ignite, and R.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett is strong in prolonged fights, possessing sustained damage and sustain. Sett's shield from his W and his ability to counterattack with his E are very effective against Kled's short-term burst attacks. Additionally, Sett excels in close-quarters brawling, and there is a high risk of being countered by Sett's W when Kled charges in. Furthermore, Sett has true damage, making it easier to chip away at Kled's durability, especially when Kled loses Skarl.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to utilize Q for long-range harassment and maneuver to avoid triggering Sett's W. After level 3, it is necessary to disengage immediately after executing a short combo to avoid Sett's counterattack. Also, when Sett approaches with his E, you can reduce the chances of a counter by avoiding the center of his W and circling around to the side. When roaming, always be aware of Sett's movements and try to safely push minions under the tower."
    },
    "loses": {
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control (CC) and excels at hindering Sett's approach. Sett has limited means of closing the gap, and by using K'Sante's E to create distance, it becomes easier to avoid Sett's attacks. Additionally, in K'Sante's all-out state, damage increases and one-on-one performance improves, making it easier to gain the upper hand in trades with Sett.\n\nTo take advantage, first, keep the wave near the tower in the lane and use E to create distance when Sett approaches. To avoid Sett's W true damage, trades should be short, utilizing K'Sante's shield to maintain durability. After level 6, using R to pull Sett under the tower can restrict Sett's movements and increase opportunities to deal damage. Additionally, building armor to reduce Sett's damage and capitalizing on mistakes to create advantageous situations is crucial.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has powerful sustain healing abilities in the mid to late game, allowing him to counter Sett's short-term burst damage. In particular, by using Bloodmire's ultimate, he can heal while taking damage from Sett and turn the situation around. Additionally, Bloodmire can utilize the slow effect from his E to hinder Sett's approach while harassing with his Q. This reduces the risk of taking damage from Sett while continuously dealing damage.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first prioritize CS in the early game while using E and Q to disrupt Sett's healing. When Sett approaches, it's important to use your ultimate to take damage while gaining healing and surviving. After level 6, utilize your ultimate to continuously deal damage while taking hits from Sett, aiming for a turnaround. Once your items are ready, you can side push and aim to excel in team fights and roaming. By placing wards appropriately and being aware of jungle interventions, you can create even more advantageous situations.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, making it easier to hinder Sett's approach. In particular, by using Gragas's Q (Barrel) to restrict Sett's movement and applying a stun with W (Body Slam), Gragas can prevent Sett from utilizing his strengths in melee combat. Additionally, Gragas has high lane sustain, and if mana management is done well, he can continuously harass Sett.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to fight within the minion wave first. When Gragas's skills hit the minions, it disrupts Sett's combos and makes it harder for him to activate Phase Rush to escape. Also, before level 6, it is effective to pressure Sett to prevent him from backing for the first time, taking advantage of Gragas's poor mana management. Furthermore, purchasing Tenacity or Mercury's Treads can reduce Sett's crowd control and increase opportunities for counterattacks. Utilizing bushes to make it easier to land skills is also a key point for Gragas to maintain his advantage.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has high mobility in mini form and can harass with his Q. Sett excels in close combat, but Gnar can attack while maintaining distance, making it easier to avoid Sett's attacks. Additionally, by using Gnar's E (Jump), he can dodge Sett's attacks while creating opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, in Mega Gnar form, he has high base stats and powerful crowd control, allowing him to disable Sett effectively in team fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to focus on farming in the early game, securing CS while avoiding Sett's Q. As levels increase, when Sett becomes more aggressive, Gnar should maintain distance and harass with his Q. When transforming into Mega Gnar at level 6, he should maneuver to avoid Sett's attacks and utilize his E's crowd control to contribute in team fights. Additionally, in terms of item selection, choosing items that can counter Sett's damage will allow for a more favorable matchup.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum is strong in lane management and sustained fights, especially being able to withstand Sett's short combos between levels 2 and 5. Utilizing Braum's E (stun) and healing abilities, he can deflect Sett's attacks and create opportunities for counterattacks. Additionally, Braum has a powerful ultimate after level 6, allowing him to play favorably against Sett.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, consolidate the wave on your side and avoid provoking Sett's short trades. Be careful not to push too much, as it can give Sett a favorable situation. Between levels 2 and 5, it is crucial to capitalize on Braum's sustained damage and healing the moment Sett's defensive skills are down. Particularly, counterattacking after forcing Sett to use his W (big damage) can leverage Braum's superiority.\n\nAfter level 6, the outcome of the match can hinge on both players' ultimates, so it is important to avoid getting caught by Sett and isolated, while also being aware of potential jungle interventions from allies. By quickly assembling durability items and choosing a build aimed at prolonged fights, you can maximize Braum's strengths. In team fights, Braum can extend as a frontline, while Sett focuses on taking down key enemies, thereby enhancing the overall combat power of the team.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox deals high damage against Sett, especially excelling in sustained attacks. Aatrox's passive healing ability provides continuous durability in trades with Sett. Additionally, using Aatrox's E skill allows him to dodge Sett's W, making it possible to engage in favorable trades. Furthermore, since Sett has limited means of closing the gap, Aatrox can attack while maintaining distance, and it is important to maneuver in a way that prevents Sett from building up his Grit.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to first use the E skill to dodge Sett's W. Next, poking Sett with the Q skill and then going all-in when his HP is below half or when he misses his E is effective. Also, utilizing the sweet spot of the Q while maintaining distance is important to avoid entering Sett's melee range. If Sett uses his E, it is an opportunity to attack, so you should be aggressive. Finally, purchasing items like Ninja Tabi or Bramble Vest can reduce Sett's damage and allow for a more favorable fight.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Kail becomes Ranged and can deal powerful DPS, allowing for sustained harassment against Sett. In particular, Sett excels in close combat, and having Ranged attacks enables Kail to deal damage while avoiding Sett's attacks. Additionally, by utilizing Kail's ultimate, which grants invulnerability, she can dodge Sett's powerful attacks while gaining opportunities to counterattack.\n\nTo take advantage of this, it is important to endure the bullying from Sett until level 6. Once you reach level 6, purchasing Guinsoo's Rageblade and quickly acquiring Swift Shoes will allow you to maintain distance while fighting Sett. Avoiding Sett's Q is crucial, as doing so prevents him from closing the gap and allows you to continue harassing. Being aware of the range of your E and dodging Sett's attacks will further enhance your advantage. By maximizing your Q at level 6 and then enhancing your E, you can increase your damage output and pressure Sett even more.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton excels in short trades and can maneuver advantageously by avoiding Sett's W. Sett is very strong at levels 1 and 2, but Renekton can gain the upper hand in subsequent trades. Additionally, Renekton's E allows him to blink, avoiding Sett's attacks while creating opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, Renekton's W can break Sett's shield, making it effective in reducing Sett's durability.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to manage the wave situation and engage when Sett is pushed under the tower. By focusing on short trades and using the E1-Q-basic attack-W-E2 combo for quick in-and-out movements, you can deal damage to Sett while avoiding his skills. Also, forcing Sett to miss his E creates opportunities for attacks. After Sett uses his W, be careful not to engage in long trades and look for the right timing to initiate another trade. Choosing PTA as a rune can increase damage in short trades.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has an ultimate skill that can negate Sett's E and R after level 6, allowing him to attack while avoiding Sett's powerful crowd control. Additionally, Olaf's attack speed and lifesteal increase as his HP decreases, making him strong in prolonged skirmishes, and he can turn the tables even when taking damage from Sett's W. Furthermore, Olaf can deal continuous damage to Sett by applying a slow with his Q and closing the gap with his E.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize farming until reaching level 6 and to purchase Ninja Tabi early. Equipping Ninja Tabi can reduce damage from Sett's basic attacks and W. After level 6, it is advisable to actively trade when Sett cannot use his E or R. Fighting near walls can also cut off Sett's escape routes, allowing Olaf to continue dealing damage with his sustainability. By using W and then circling behind Sett, you can create an even more advantageous situation.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi is a fighter who excels in close combat, and she has a high ability to withstand Sett's attacks. By landing her E (Test of Spirit), she can pull Sett in, deal damage, and apply a slow effect. This allows her to limit Sett's attacks and create opportunities for counterattacks. Additionally, Illaoi can deal sustained damage using her tentacles, making her particularly powerful in fights within areas where her tentacles are present. When taking Sett's attacks, she can use her W (Counter) to reduce damage and utilize her tentacles to retaliate.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game, aim for E safely behind minions and adjust your angles to avoid Sett's E. Manage the minions and use your allies' crowd control to maximize damage with Q (Tentacle Smash). When Sett attacks, counter with W and connect to the tentacle to sustain damage while maintaining durability. After level 6, when using R (Leap of Faith) to engage in team fights, it's important to be mindful of positioning to avoid being pulled away by Sett's R. This way, Illaoi can leverage her advantage in prolonged fights and maneuver favorably against Sett.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven possesses high mobility and burst damage, allowing her to effectively counter Sett's short-term damage and sustain. Riven's skills can maximize damage through consecutive use, enabling her to quickly whittle down Sett's shields and durability. Additionally, Riven can avoid trades in close combat and deal damage with short combos before quickly disengaging, making her less susceptible to Sett's counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, initially, from levels 1 to 2, do not force engagements and conserve Q while managing minions. After level 3, use a short combo of Q→W→E to quickly chip away at Sett and then disengage immediately. It is crucial to avoid Sett's W and E, especially by baiting Sett's E and then counterattacking, allowing Riven to utilize her stun to deal damage. At level 6, using R and forcing Sett to expend his escape skills before engaging can further enhance Riven's advantage in the fight.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability and versatile crowd control, allowing him to withstand Sett's attacks. He can disrupt Sett from a distance with his Q and maintain distance with his E, making it easier to prevent Sett from closing in. Additionally, Ornn's R has a powerful knock-up, which helps with engaging in team fights and limiting Sett's movements. Furthermore, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane maintenance and giving him an edge in sustained combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to prioritize minion management in the early game, dealing damage to Sett with Q while keeping distance with E. When Sett charges in with his E, you can intercept with W and look for a chance to counterattack. After level 6, it's effective to conserve R, read Sett's movements, and coordinate with your jungle for safe poking. In team fights, Ornn can maintain the frontline, creating situations where Sett targets the backline, allowing the entire team to engage favorably in combat."

    "beats": {
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the magic damage and self-healing capabilities that Mordekaiser possesses. Mordekaiser can create a forced 1v1 situation with his R at level 6, maximizing his strengths when isolated. Additionally, Mordekaiser's passive provides sustained damage and shields, making him highly durable against Malphite's physical attacks and allowing him to excel in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Malphite's hard CC is limited to his R, and he has few means to prevent Mordekaiser's approach with his E.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the early lane phase, it is important to focus on minion management and avoid unnecessary aggression. Harass with Q to disrupt Mordekaiser's healing. Buying a Bramble Vest before 3-4 items is effective in reducing Mordekaiser's healing. Pay special attention to the timing at level 6, and engage when allies are nearby to avoid isolation. In team fights, it is crucial to leverage Malphite's strengths by using R to knock up enemies and create chaos.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is strong in close combat, especially after level 6, as he can force a 1v1 situation with his ultimate (R). Garen has a silence (Q), but it is difficult to counter Mordekaiser's shield and sustained damage. Additionally, Mordekaiser's E skill increases his movement speed and provides continuous damage, making it hard for Garen to approach. Furthermore, Garen lacks ranged attack options, which means he cannot avoid Mordekaiser's AoE skills and becomes disadvantaged in long trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, until reaching level 6, it is important not to force the wave and to avoid Mordekaiser's skills. If the wave is pushed out, consider making short trades and using Mordekaiser's AoE skills to push the wave back. In terms of item build, choosing a Negatron Cloak can help reduce Mordekaiser's damage. Finally, it is crucial to coordinate with the team to secure objectives and to lead Mordekaiser to the side lane, preventing him from utilizing his strengths.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that she is forced into a 1v1 situation by Mordekaiser's R. By using his R, Mordekaiser isolates Illaoi and nullifies her sustained damage and healing capabilities. Additionally, Illaoi has low mobility, and when pulled in by Mordekaiser's E, she easily loses opportunities to counterattack. Furthermore, Mordekaiser deals magic damage, which is effective at chipping away at Illaoi's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, from levels 1 to 5, focus on pushing the minions while being aware of the tentacles, and use E to gain an advantage in trades. After level 6, it is crucial to be cautious of Mordekaiser's R and to wait for allies to intervene instead of forcing engagements. In team fights, deploying tentacles and positioning to avoid Mordekaiser's R can help turn the battle in your favor. Coordinating with teammates and avoiding isolation is key.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Mordekaiser can easily catch Teemo with his powerful single-target ultimate. Mordekaiser's E is a means of closing the gap, and since it has a long cooldown, it becomes difficult for Teemo to maintain distance. Additionally, Mordekaiser has tank-like traits and can deal sustained damage, making Teemo's poke less effective. Furthermore, Teemo has low base durability and is vulnerable in team fights, making him susceptible to Mordekaiser's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to continuously apply poison with E while using Q to disrupt Mordekaiser's auto-attack trades and poke from a distance. After level 6, it is crucial to be cautious of Mordekaiser's R, saving Flash or Blink to avoid isolation and staying close to allies. Additionally, properly placing mushrooms to secure vision and limit enemy movement can create advantages in team fights.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has a high ability to deal sustained magic damage, and especially when forced into a 1v1 situation by his R, he can wear down Dr. Mundo's durability. Mordekaiser's E and W shields, as well as burst damage, can potentially exceed Mundo's healing capabilities. Additionally, Mordekaiser is strong in long trades and has advantageous traits against tank champions.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize safety in the early lane phase, dealing damage by poking with Q while hiding behind minions, and aiming for a long-term battle. After confirming Mordekaiser's E and W shields, retaliate, and engage in a short skirmish with Q followed by an auto-attack when the shields are consumed. Also, before level 6, it is effective to avoid risky 1v1s and seek jungle assistance. Prioritize magic resistance items in your core build, and while utilizing HP regeneration, it is crucial to coordinate with teammates when aiming for a turnaround with your R.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Mordekaiser's short-term single-target burst potential and his ability to force 1v1 situations with his R. After level 6, Mordekaiser can isolate Bloodmire using his R, which can suppress Bloodmire's sustained healing. Additionally, Mordekaiser's W provides a shield that mitigates Bloodmire's damage, giving him an advantage in short trades. Furthermore, Bloodmire is weak against early short bursts of damage, and he can easily find himself in a tough situation when taking hits from Mordekaiser.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. During the laning phase, avoid unnecessary short trades and focus on farming with Q while leveling up.\n2. Utilize W (Pool) to dodge Mordekaiser's key skills (Q and E) to avoid taking damage.\n3. After level 6, use your R after forcing Mordekaiser to use his R, and look for the right timing to engage in a longer fight.\n4. In team fights, avoid being isolated by Mordekaiser and focus on dealing sustained damage to multiple enemies.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe main reason for this is that Mordekaiser's R creates a forced 1v1 situation. Mordekaiser has a powerful shield and high sustained damage output, making it difficult for Sett to gain the upper hand in close combat. Additionally, Mordekaiser's E pull can be troublesome, potentially disrupting Sett as he tries to engage. Furthermore, after level 6, it becomes crucial to cancel Mordekaiser's R, and failing to do so puts Sett in a very tough spot.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to gain a lead before level 6. Sett can use his W from level 1 to auto-attack and aim for first blood. By engaging in short trades, he can reduce the effectiveness of Mordekaiser's W, lowering his tankiness and sustain. Additionally, if Sett can predict Mordekaiser's R and cancel it with his own R, he can turn the tide of the battle in his favor. Choosing a tank build can also be a strategy to increase durability and prolong fights.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is strong in close combat, especially because he can force a 1v1 situation with his ultimate (R). Mordekaiser has a shield and can deal sustained damage with his passive skill, making him very powerful against tank champions. Additionally, Urgot has a short range, and when approaching, he can be pulled in by Mordekaiser's E, making him vulnerable to attacks. Furthermore, Mordekaiser's Q is an area attack that can hit minions, which can affect Urgot's farming.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to take advantage of Mordekaiser's weaknesses at levels 1-2 and initiate an early attack. Building QSS first can be effective in negating Mordekaiser's ultimate (R). Additionally, it is crucial to time your approach considering the cooldown of Mordekaiser's E. If you can take down Mordekaiser before level 6, it will make lane maintenance easier afterward. Finally, choosing items like \"Swift Shoes\" and \"BC\" in your build can enhance mobility, allowing you to continue farming while avoiding contact with Mordekaiser.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has a powerful 1v1 elimination ability with his R at level 6, and Sion is very weak in that situation. Mordekaiser's sustained damage and healing can also potentially surpass Sion's durability. Additionally, Sion relies on close combat, making him susceptible to damage from Mordekaiser's E pull and Q trades, which puts him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Sion has slow skill activation, making it difficult to hit the highly mobile Mordekaiser.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forced prolonged fights in the early game and focus on harassing while clearing minions with Q. Also, seeking jungle support to initiate team fights before reaching level 6 can create opportunities to isolate Mordekaiser. As for items, choosing tank equipment (like Titanic Hydra or Thornmail) can enhance durability and allow for more favorable trades against Mordekaiser. Additionally, in team fights, leveraging Sion's strong crowd control to coordinate with allies and aim to eliminate Mordekaiser would be beneficial.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the powerful one-on-one performance and sustained damage that Mordekaiser has against Renekton. Once Mordekaiser completes his Rylai's, especially after level 6, his sustainability increases, allowing him to withstand Renekton's attacks. Additionally, Mordekaiser's E ability, \"Pull,\" can hinder Renekton's approach, making it easier for Mordekaiser to ignore the damage from Renekton's Q ability. Furthermore, when Mordekaiser's R ability forces a one-on-one situation, Renekton is likely to find himself in an unfavorable position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to push Mordekaiser before reaching level 6. By gaining early control and prioritizing farming, you can suppress Mordekaiser's growth. It is also crucial to be aware of avoiding Mordekaiser's E and Q abilities and to time your approach carefully. Additionally, in terms of item builds, purchasing anti-heal items early can hinder Mordekaiser's healing. Finally, strengthening coordination with the jungle and aiming for ganks can effectively apply pressure on Mordekaiser.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe main reason is that being forced into a 1v1 situation by Mordekaiser's R is a significant factor. Mordekaiser is very strong in 1v1s, with sustained damage and a shield, which means that even if Kled charges in, he could end up being isolated. Additionally, the sustained damage from Mordekaiser's E and Q can make Kled vulnerable when he loses Skarl. Furthermore, while Kled excels in close combat, Mordekaiser's skills make it difficult for him to engage, leading to unfavorable trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to actively harass before reaching level 6, aiming for a quick resolution while avoiding Mordekaiser's E and Q. Also, coordinating with the allied jungler to launch a group attack on Mordekaiser can help negate the effects of his R. Additionally, in terms of item selection, choosing items like Black Cleaver or Mercury's Treads can effectively reduce Mordekaiser's sustained damage and provide escape options.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Mordekaiser's strong 1v1 capabilities and Nasus's early game weakness. Mordekaiser has a shield from his W and sustained damage, and he can create advantageous situations by isolating Nasus with his R. Nasus needs to prioritize farming in the early game and is vulnerable to Mordekaiser's harassment and burst damage. Additionally, since Nasus's only means of approach is the slow from his E, it is difficult to avoid Mordekaiser's attacks, especially after level 6 when the risk of being attacked unilaterally increases due to his R.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force engagements in the early game and to prioritize farming minions. Use E to reduce Mordekaiser's attack speed and maneuver to avoid harassment. Having teleport allows you to maintain stable farming without leaving the lane. After level 6, it is crucial to wait for ally intervention and avoid trading alone. In team fights, Nasus can continue to land Q from the back, and when Mordekaiser uses his R, allies can either interrupt him or use crowd control to capitalize on Nasus's strengths.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the powerful 1v1 performance and CC skills that Mordekaiser possesses. Mordekaiser can close the gap with his E skill, deal sustained damage while enhancing his auto-attacks with his Q, and create a 1v1 situation by isolating Cho'Gath in the afterlife with his R. While Cho'Gath has silence and CC, it is difficult to counter Mordekaiser's sustained damage and shield, especially after level 6 when the risk of being attacked unilaterally by Mordekaiser's R increases.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Early Lane Management**: It is important for Cho'Gath to avoid risky 1v1s in the early game and prioritize minion farming and experience to stabilize the lane. It is effective to look for counterattacks during Mordekaiser's Q cooldown.\n\n2. **Jungle Support**: Since Mordekaiser has strong 1v1 capabilities, seeking support from the jungle can be effective. Applying pressure on Mordekaiser, especially before level 6, increases the chances for Cho'Gath to gain an advantage.\n\n3. **Flash Management**: To avoid being isolated by Mordekaiser's R, it is crucial to conserve Flash and use it at the necessary moment. If isolated, consider relying on allies for intervention.\n\n4. **Item Selection**: Cho'Gath should prioritize durability and choose items with magic resistance and physical resistance to reduce Mordekaiser's damage. In particular, selecting items that increase HP is effective in countering Mordekaiser's sustained damage.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the powerful 1v1 performance and sustained damage that Mordekaiser possesses. Mordekaiser has a shield with his W and can close the gap and pull Shen in with his E, allowing him to continuously deal damage even if Shen tries to engage in short trades. Additionally, when forced into a 1v1 situation by Mordekaiser's R, Shen becomes isolated, making it easier for Mordekaiser to capitalize on his strengths. Furthermore, Shen lacks AoE damage and his damage output in team fights heavily relies on his allies, which often puts him at a disadvantage in prolonged engagements against Mordekaiser.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to focus on short trades to exhaust Mordekaiser's W. After taunting with E, dealing short-term damage with Q and quickly disengaging can reduce risk. Additionally, purchasing Bramble Vest early can hinder Mordekaiser's healing, helping to mitigate his sustained damage. After reaching level 6, it is crucial to use R to rescue allies when they are caught, creating opportunities to fight advantageously through coordination. In team fights, aim to taunt the main damage dealers with E while protecting your allies and focusing on reducing Mordekaiser's healing.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is strong in close combat and has the ability to force 1v1 situations with his R. While Camille has high mobility, she needs to be cautious of Mordekaiser's E pull and sustained damage. Additionally, Mordekaiser has high durability as a tank, making it difficult for Camille's burst damage to be effective in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Camille lacks AoE attacks, which makes it easier for Mordekaiser to capitalize on his strengths in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to engage in short trades in the early lane phase and use the cooldown of Mordekaiser's E to create distance. After level 6, while being wary of his R, it is effective to maneuver with the support of allies to either avoid Mordekaiser's R or stop it with crowd control before it activates. When you have an item advantage, using your R to aggressively engage can also be a viable strategy to aim for an early resolution.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is strong in prolonged fights, and especially when his R (Ultimate) forces a 1v1 situation, Rumble finds himself in a very unfavorable position. Mordekaiser's W (Shield) increases his durability, and with his passive dealing sustained damage, it becomes difficult for Rumble to gain an advantage in short trades. Additionally, Mordekaiser excels in close combat, and against Rumble, who has a long cooldown on his E (engagement tool), he can easily close the gap and initiate attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early laning phase, utilize Q (Flamespitter) for harassment, and aim for favorable trades against Mordekaiser by applying a slow with E before hitting with Q. Avoid overcommitting while his W (Shield) is active, and engage in skirmishes when it expires. After level 6, it is crucial to be wary of Mordekaiser's R and to avoid isolation. Waiting for ally intervention or using Zhonya to buy time can help reduce the impact of Mordekaiser's R. In team fights, using R (Equalizer) to block Mordekaiser's escape route and prioritizing attacks from a distance can help avoid close engagements."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick has strong early push power, making it easier to create a favorable lane against Mordekaiser using minions. In particular, Yorick's attacks with Mist Walkers are effective against Mordekaiser's shield and sustained damage. Additionally, Yorick can overwhelm Mordekaiser before level 6, allowing him to gain an advantage in short skirmishes.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to push minions early and get close to the opponent's tower. Use wards to secure vision and keep track of Mordekaiser's movements. Between levels 2 and 5, engage in short skirmishes using minions, dealing damage with Q while whittling down the opponent with W. After level 6, while being cautious of Mordekaiser's R, utilize Maiden to engage in short skirmishes repeatedly, continuously chipping away at the opponent's health. If Mordekaiser uses his R, you can create distance and wait for your allies to intervene, allowing for a prolonged fight.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses high mobility and burst damage, making it easier to aim for a quick finish against Mordekaiser in a long fight. Mordekaiser relies on close combat and especially forces 1v1 situations with his R (Realm of Death), but Yone can maneuver to avoid that R. Additionally, Yone's skills do not consume mana and have short cooldowns, allowing him to maintain his lane effectively while continuously dealing damage while avoiding Mordekaiser's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, it is important to repeatedly engage in short trades, securing last hits with Q, and immediately returning to the main body with E after an auto-attack to avoid Mordekaiser's attacks. After level 6, while being cautious of Mordekaiser's R, it is crucial to avoid isolation and coordinate with allies to time attacks on Mordekaiser. If Mordekaiser's R is unavailable, ideally, approach with E, deal damage with E, and then use Q, followed by R (Yone) just before returning with E to take him down with burst damage.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has the ability to overwhelm Mordekaiser in the early game. Specifically, she can use her E to dodge Mordekaiser's attacks while dealing significant damage with her Q. Additionally, Gwen has percentage damage and true damage, allowing her to ignore Mordekaiser's shield and deal damage effectively against tanks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to initiate attacks by utilizing the cooldown of Mordekaiser's Q in the early game. Gwen can dodge Mordekaiser's E with her E and deal damage by landing her Q. Furthermore, having Ignite increases kill pressure, and it is effective to continue attacking when Mordekaiser tries to retaliate. Also, ganking Mordekaiser with the help of the jungler before level 6 can help establish an advantage.\n\nIn terms of item build, considering Spirit Visage is important, and using W to block Mordekaiser's passive Q and E is crucial. In team fights, it is also important to communicate to the team not to focus on Mordekaiser, as Gwen has a high impact. In the late game, care must be taken to avoid taking damage during Mordekaiser's ultimate, as his Q remains powerful.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar possesses high base stats and mobility through his transformation, and especially in Mega Gnar form, he can leverage powerful AoE damage and crowd control to counter Mordekaiser. In his mini form, Gnar can utilize his high mobility to dodge Mordekaiser's attacks while harassing him, making it difficult for Mordekaiser to approach. Additionally, Gnar's all-in potential is strong due to his transformation, allowing him to effectively deal with Mordekaiser's ultimate.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to prioritize leveling up and focus on CS to enhance Gnar early on. Before Mordekaiser's ultimate is used, coordinating with teammates to fight is crucial, especially when his ultimate is activated, as maintaining distance while using skills is key. By using Gnar's Q to harass, dodging Mordekaiser's skills with W, closing the gap with E, and transforming into Mega Gnar with R before going all-in, Gnar can fight favorably against Mordekaiser. Additionally, securing vision and avoiding ambushes is also important.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, especially in prolonged fights. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and due to the long cooldown of his E skill, it becomes difficult for him to avoid Singed's poison. Additionally, Singed can proxy farm, allowing him to spread poison while avoiding Mordekaiser's attacks and dealing damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to proxy farm between the 1 to 5 minute mark to avoid minion fights. You should not isolate yourself to avoid triggering Mordekaiser's R, and it is necessary to maneuver around your allies' vision and under towers. Also, it is advisable to conserve your E skill and be ready to assist allies who are caught by Mordekaiser's R. Purchasing magic resistance items early and utilizing Rylai or Liandry can help you fight favorably against Mordekaiser. After level 6, the key is to continue dealing sustained damage when Mordekaiser is isolated.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven has high burst damage in the early game and can apply pressure on Mordekaiser using Q combos, especially between levels 1 and 3. Mordekaiser relies on close combat and has a long cooldown on his E skill, allowing Riven to utilize her mobility to avoid attacks while dealing damage. Additionally, Riven has no skill costs, enabling her to continuously attack and easily create a sustain advantage.\n\nTo take advantage, first, spam Q in the early game to pressure Mordekaiser while avoiding auto-attack trades. Riven should aim for a quick resolution before reaching level 6. After level 6, Mordekaiser's R makes one-on-one situations more difficult, so it's important to avoid close combat and maintain distance while fighting. As for items, prioritize Mercury's Treads and QSS to avoid Mordekaiser's CC, and later aim for Black Cleaver or Sterak's Gage to increase durability.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has a trait that increases his attack speed and lifesteal as his HP decreases, making him strong in prolonged fights. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and since his E has a long cooldown, it becomes difficult for him to approach Olaf when he is slowed. Additionally, Olaf can attack while negating crowd control with his R, making it easier to counter Mordekaiser's isolation from his Ult. Furthermore, Olaf deals true damage, allowing him to output sufficient damage against Mordekaiser as a tank.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (1-5), aim to hit Q and initiate short trades with E and W to create a health advantage. Mordekaiser will respond using the shield from his E, so it’s important to use minions to disrupt his positioning. Before level 6, Olaf should maintain a health advantage while continuing to attack, as Mordekaiser will be cautious of the power of his R and will try to avoid isolation. After level 6, when Mordekaiser uses his R, Olaf should either call for allies or create distance to prevent being isolated. In team fights, Olaf plays the role of breaking through the frontline while negating crowd control and applying pressure to the enemy carries.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum is strong in close combat from the early game, especially between levels 1 and 5, where he can chip away at the opponent's HP in short skirmishes. Additionally, Braum's passive increases his attack speed, allowing him to gain an edge over Mordekaiser with consecutive attacks. Furthermore, Braum's W stun effect can hinder Mordekaiser's approach, which is particularly effective against Mordekaiser, who has a long cooldown on his E skill.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to manage minions early and secure level 2 first. Focus on chipping away at Mordekaiser's HP in short skirmishes and avoid prolonged fights. Before level 6, coordinate with the jungle for tower dives and side pressure to deny Mordekaiser farm. After level 6, be cautious of Mordekaiser's R and avoid engaging in easy 1v1s. Engaging after he uses his R can be effective, allowing you to use Ignite to bring him into kill range. Additionally, securing MR early and opting for a more tanky build prepares you for longer fights. It is also important to focus on team coordination, establish vision to invite ganks, and disperse the threat of Mordekaiser's R in team fights.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has a long-range Q ability from the early game, making it easy to harass Mordekaiser. Additionally, Gragas's W provides damage reduction, allowing him to withstand Mordekaiser's attacks. Furthermore, Gragas can use his E to catch enemies, giving him an edge in short skirmishes. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and when affected by Gragas's crowd control, his movement is restricted, making it easier for Gragas to create advantageous situations.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, aim to attack from a distance with Q and force Mordekaiser to use his W. Engage in short skirmishes around levels 3-4, using Gragas's E to deal burst damage and chip away at Mordekaiser's healing. After level 6, use Gragas's R to create distance while being cautious of Mordekaiser's ultimate, ensuring not to isolate yourself. Encouraging ally intervention and utilizing Gragas's crowd control to create favorable situations will be key to victory.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has very high burst damage in the early game, and especially between levels 1 and 5, he can apply pressure on Mordekaiser by using a short combo (W→Q→E). Mordekaiser is relatively weak in the early game, and it is difficult for him to withstand Pantheon's burst during short trades, making it easier for Pantheon to create advantageous situations. Additionally, Pantheon has a global ultimate, which allows for easy roaming to other lanes and can impact the game as a whole.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively trade against Mordekaiser in the early laning phase while securing CS and whittling down the opponent's health. Ideally, you want to apply pressure before reaching level 6 and aim for a kill if possible. After level 6, it is crucial to be wary of Mordekaiser's ultimate and to disengage immediately if it is used. Furthermore, joining a side lane with your ultimate can create advantages in other lanes as well. In team fights, be careful not to isolate Mordekaiser while looking to initiate from the side with your roams.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has sustained healing abilities and can deal powerful damage, especially when his HP is low. After stripping away the shield from Mordekaiser's W, he can gain the upper hand in short trades. Additionally, Warwick's R can suppress Mordekaiser, nullifying his powerful skills and allowing Warwick to gain an advantage in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on CS in the early laning phase while maintaining healing with Warwick's Q, and aim for the cooldown of Mordekaiser's W. When Mordekaiser's W is down, initiate an attack while being careful not to get pulled in by his E. When using R, time it so that it doesn't trigger Mordekaiser's R or E, and engage when allies can intervene for an even greater advantage. As for items, choosing gear that increases lifesteal and attack speed can enhance Warwick's strength in skirmishes.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and can deal sustained DPS, making it easier to manage distance from Mordekaiser. In particular, by creating distance before receiving Mordekaiser's R, you can avoid his powerful single-target kill potential. Additionally, Anbessa can use dashes to evade Mordekaiser's attacks while dealing short bursts of damage, allowing for advantageous trades.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, utilize your passive to build charges and harass while zoning with E through minions. Between levels 3 and 5, use minions as a shield to deal damage with short combos (E → AA passive → Q) and avoid unnecessary long trades. After level 6, be cautious of Mordekaiser's R and avoid engaging when he has it. Secure vision, maintain distance when his R is activated, and call for allies to fight safely. In the mid to late game, use shield W to roam to carries or join with TP, and by surrounding Mordekaiser with multiple champions, you can put him at a disadvantage.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control and can particularly negate Mordekaiser's ultimate in one-on-one situations. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and since his E skill has a long cooldown, K'Sante can effectively maintain distance during fights, making it easier to avoid Mordekaiser's attacks. Additionally, in K'Sante's all-out state, his damage increases, allowing him to create favorable conditions for fighting against Mordekaiser.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to prioritize farming until reaching level 6 and to avoid trades. Freezing the lane allows K'Sante to dodge Mordekaiser's Q by positioning himself among the minions. During resets, purchasing Spectral Cowl or Negatron Cloak and rushing to build Caenic Lucan can increase magic resistance while boosting damage. By avoiding short trades and attacking when Mordekaiser's Q or E is missed, K'Sante can gain the upper hand. After level 6, he can create opportunities to take down Mordekaiser by aiming for good kidnap angles. In the late game, by organizing items, K'Sante can fight almost evenly, so it is crucial for him to farm well and prepare his items.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn excels in long-range solo trades, particularly using his E for knock-ups and Q for damage, allowing him to avoid close combat with Mordekaiser. Additionally, as Ornn levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him a powerful presence in the late game. Furthermore, Ornn's impact in team fights with his R is significant, and by positioning himself to avoid Mordekaiser's R, he can lead the fight in a favorable direction.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, in the early game, use E to utilize the terrain and aim for knock-ups against Mordekaiser. Avoid prolonged close combat and attack while creating angles using minions. Next, use Bramble to suppress Mordekaiser's healing and purchase magic resistance items early to mitigate his damage. After level 6, be aware of the danger of 1v1s due to Mordekaiser's R, while securing vision and coordinating with allies. In team fights, leverage Ornn's R to knock up enemies and empower allies, allowing the fight to progress favorably. It is important to avoid unnecessary 1v1s and aim for a scaling victory.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is relatively weak until he reaches level 6, and especially in the early stages, Jax can deal damage without triggering Mordekaiser's passive by engaging in short trades. Additionally, by using Jax's E (Counter Strike), he can prevent Mordekaiser's combo (E > Q > AA), allowing him to stun and then disengage. Furthermore, Jax has an attack speed buff, which enables him to deal high DPS in auto-attack-based fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to stack Little Tempo before level 6 and aim for early kills. Engaging in short trades and avoiding Mordekaiser's skills (especially E) is key. When Mordekaiser's Q misses, it presents an opportunity for extended trades. In terms of item build, prioritize Trinity Force, Shojin, and Blade of the Ruined King, considering purchasing Blade of the Ruined King first if you are ahead. Manage the wave to avoid taking poke from Mordekaiser's Q and fight when his W is not stacked, as this is the path to victory.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce excels at poking from a distance and can deal damage to Mordekaiser while maintaining distance using the E→Q combo. Mordekaiser is strong in close combat but is vulnerable to attacks from afar. Additionally, after reaching level 6, Jayce can use his R to avoid being isolated by Mordekaiser's R, allowing him to avoid one-on-one duels.\n\nTo gain the advantage, during the early game (1–5), always use E→Q within range and position yourself to prevent Mordekaiser from getting close. It's important to manage distance using minions and avoid the opponent's attacks. Once you reach level 6, be cautious of when Mordekaiser uses his R and avoid going too deep alone. In the mid-game, create advantages by utilizing roams and side lane pressure, and in team fights, it’s effective to avoid Mordekaiser’s R while coordinating with other champions. In terms of items, focus on mobility and durability, and don’t forget to secure vision and be wary of bushes and grass.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in early short trades and can deal sustained damage due to his passive bleeding effect. In particular, by healing with Darius's Q while pulling Mordekaiser in with E, it becomes easier to accumulate damage. Additionally, while Darius is strong in long trades, Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and since E has a long cooldown, Darius can take the initiative to attack first, giving him an advantage.\n\nTo take advantage, apply pressure between levels 1 and 3, collect minions with Q while using E to pull Mordekaiser and initiate a fight. It is especially important to stack Hemorrhage to accumulate damage and aim for an all-in before the opponent can retaliate. At level 6, Mordekaiser's R can be dangerous for isolation, but managing the wave beforehand and freezing the lane near the tower can effectively prevent Mordekaiser from using his R. For item build, prioritize Black Cleaver, then build Sterak to increase durability, and having Ignite can further increase damage."

    "beats": {
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Sion's high durability and AoE damage, particularly his engage ability in team fights. Sion has a passive that allows him to wreak havoc for a certain period after dying, making him very powerful in prolonged battles. Additionally, while Sion's Q has a slow cast time, it deals significant damage when it hits, making it difficult for Malphite to avoid that attack. Furthermore, Sion has many CC skills, and his R's charge and knock-up are particularly threatening to Malphite.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is crucial to manage minions effectively and avoid Sion's Q. Use EQ for short-term harassment and focus on whittling down his health. Also, it is important to maintain distance from Sion's R. Timing your own R effectively in team fights is necessary to either negate Sion's charge or engage other enemy champions. In terms of items, choosing Bramble Vest as your first item can help reduce Sion's healing.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and strong crowd control, particularly excelling in engage during team fights. Sion's Q poke and E snare are troublesome, and it is difficult for Yorick to avoid Sion's Q, making him susceptible to damage. Additionally, Sion's R roaming and intervention in team fights pose a threat, making it hard for Yorick to create 1v1 situations. Furthermore, since Yorick relies on his pets, he needs to gain an item advantage to counter Sion's durability, but Sion can close that gap by dragging the fight into the late game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to push the minions early to create a 1v1 with Sion. By avoiding Sion's Q and using E to snare him, Yorick can increase his chances of dealing damage. Also, paying attention to Sion's R roaming and managing ganks thoroughly allows Yorick to leverage his strengths before Sion can participate in team fights. As for items, choosing Conqueror and building on three-tier or mythic damage items can effectively improve sustain and damage.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and can use powerful crowd control (Q charge and W) to close the gap on Teemo. Teemo has a short range and is weak against all-ins, making him susceptible to Sion's attacks. Additionally, due to Sion's passive, he can continue to wreak havoc for a certain period after dying, meaning that even if Teemo manages to kill him, there may still be repercussions. Furthermore, Sion has no means to negate the blind effect, making it difficult for Teemo to leverage his strengths against an opponent who is immune to his blind.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, it is important to position behind minions to avoid Sion's Q and harass him.\n2. Placing mushrooms in the bushes to limit Sion's approach routes and secure vision can help create advantageous trades.\n3. Attack only after Sion has used his W or Q, avoiding unnecessary aggression while his shield is still active.\n4. For item builds, prioritize a Hextech (Nashor) AP build and secure magic resistance early to reduce Sion's damage.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to alleviate Teemo's disadvantages and maintain lane superiority.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has strong poke and crowd control in the early game. When Nasus takes damage from Sion's E or Q, it becomes difficult for him to farm. Additionally, Sion's roaming and engage potential with his R in team fights is a threat. Nasus is very weak in the early game and needs to prioritize farming, so if he takes damage from Sion's attacks, he cannot stack effectively, which delays his growth.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, avoid unnecessary trades and prioritize safely stacking minions with Q. It is important to maintain distance to avoid Sion's skills while retaliating from afar. Also, when Sion roams with his R, interrupting his minion wave clearing can minimize his impact. In the mid-game and beyond, using W to stop Sion's charges or follow-ups after his R can allow Nasus to engage in short trades and gain an advantage.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage. The reason for this is the high durability and crowd control skills of Sion. Sion has a knock-up with his Q and a shield with his W, which allows him to absorb Urgot's short-term damage output. Additionally, by dragging the fight into a prolonged engagement, Sion can continue to contribute to the battle with his passive even after dying, making it difficult for Urgot to gain an advantage. Furthermore, Urgot has a short range, making it hard to avoid Sion's Q, which often puts him at a disadvantage in trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:  \n1. Use minions to disrupt Sion's Q charge and try to avoid it as much as possible.  \n2. Engage in short trades using E and Q to minimize damage taken. Long trades should be avoided.  \n3. Look for opportunities to deal damage after Sion uses his W to counterattack.  \n4. Push the lane slightly to take advantage of the range of your R at level 6, while being cautious of Sion's engage and looking for opportunities.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Urgot can alleviate his disadvantage and play more favorably.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and powerful crowd control skills. Sion's R ability allows him to charge and knock up, which can restrict Quinn's mobility, and if Quinn tries to escape using E and gets canceled, she could take fatal damage. Additionally, Sion excels at engaging in team fights, and since Quinn's AoE damage is weak, her impact in team fights is reduced. Furthermore, Sion is favored against champions with weak harassment, and Quinn is susceptible to that harassment.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to purchase Shiv early to increase damage. After acquiring Shiv, you will need to choose whether to duel Sion or take tempo. Also, be careful not to overuse your E skill, and if you get hit by Sion's R, it is crucial to spam E to prepare for escape. Sion's Q can be canceled with E, so timing its use effectively can also be beneficial. Moreover, if Sion is proxying, consider not chasing him unnecessarily and prioritize farming in other lanes or the jungle.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and crowd control (CC), and can particularly absorb Garen's Q with his E (knock-up). Garen is a fighter who aims for short engagements, but due to Sion's sustained damage and tankiness, he becomes disadvantaged in prolonged fights. Additionally, Sion can easily push the lane and poses a threat for tower dives, so Garen needs to play cautiously from the early game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to use Q to farm minions while avoiding Sion's E. When Sion misses his E, it is effective to engage in short trades, and when reaching level 6, targeting an isolated Sion with R for a kill can be beneficial. Furthermore, against Sion's tank build, it is effective to leverage health differences to attack. Additionally, coordinating with the jungle to isolate Sion can create advantageous situations.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and can negate Jayce's harassment by charging in. Sion can charge his Q to aim for a knock-up, giving him a chance to counterattack the moment Jayce tries to engage. Additionally, Sion's R provides a threat that Jayce must be wary of, even when maintaining distance. Furthermore, Sion's tankiness makes it difficult for Jayce's burst damage to be effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important for Jayce to manage distance effectively, using E to accelerate while harassing with Q. When Sion starts charging his Q, Jayce can avoid damage by creating distance immediately. After level 6, it is crucial to be cautious of Sion's R and to coordinate with the allied jungler to create opportunities to catch Sion. In team fights, it is essential to utilize range from the frontline to continuously poke and prevent Sion from getting close.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and long crowd control, with his Q's charged attack being particularly powerful. Illaoi has low mobility, making it difficult to avoid Sion's Q, which increases her damage taken. Additionally, Sion's R charge and knock-up significantly impact Illaoi's combat style, especially in team fights where Sion initiating makes it hard for Illaoi to play advantageously.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Use minions to position yourself in a way that helps you avoid Sion's Q. Look for the right moment to engage after Sion has used his Q.\n2. Hit E on minions to spawn tentacles and deal sustained damage to Sion, especially when Sion's Q is on cooldown.\n3. After level 6, utilize your R and engage after seeing Sion's R to force him to waste his skills.\n4. Strengthen coordination with your jungler to apply pressure on Sion by looking for ganks.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Sion's high durability and AoE damage, particularly his engage ability in team fights. Sion has a shield with his W, allowing him to absorb early burst damage, making Pantheon's all-in less effective. Additionally, Sion can retaliate against Pantheon by landing a fully charged Q (Charge). Furthermore, if Sion uses his E (Knockback) to interrupt Pantheon's dash, Pantheon loses his opportunity to attack. After level 6, Sion's R (Charge) provides strong crowd control, posing a threat when Pantheon attempts to roam.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, it is important to trade aggressively between levels 1 and 3 to gain an early lead. After Sion uses his W, re-trading can be advantageous by forcing him to consume his shield. Additionally, dodging Sion's Q with E can create opportunities for counterattacks. In terms of item build, prioritizing early penetration and AD items is necessary to maximize damage. Finally, be cautious to ensure Sion does not become isolated, and coordinate with other champions in team fights to relative diminish Sion's strengths.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and strong engage with his charge. While Rumble can poke from a distance against Sion's harassment with Q and increased durability with W, he has limited means to stop Sion's charge. Additionally, Sion's ultimate charge can potentially negate Rumble's zoning with his ultimate, and in prolonged fights, Sion's durability will prevail, making Rumble more susceptible to damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Attack from behind minions with Q and apply a slow with E to limit Sion's movement while dealing damage.\n2. Avoid Sion's Q charge with W and position creatively to dodge Sion's charge.\n3. Time Sion's ultimate usage and either poke with EQ or block the path with your ultimate to restrict Sion's movement.\n4. After pushing the lane, focus on side pressure and roaming to avoid direct confrontation with Sion.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, it is possible to alleviate Rumble's disadvantage and create a more favorable situation.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Sion's high durability and strong engage potential. Sion excels at applying pressure with his Q while being able to charge in for short trades. Additionally, Sion's W provides a shield and AoE damage that can potentially outmatch Cho'Gath's sustain. Furthermore, Sion has a passive that allows him to continue to wreak havoc for a certain period after dying, giving him a lasting impact in fights. Cho'Gath has a slow skill activation and is susceptible to Sion's CC and damage, making it particularly difficult to react to Sion's R charge.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to play defensively in lane, avoiding Sion's Q while using E to farm. Look for opportunities to counterattack when Sion misses his Q, using the W→Q→E combo to deal damage. Additionally, against Sion's R, it is effective to save Cho'Gath's R and use it at a time when a kill is guaranteed. Furthermore, building MR can help reduce Sion's damage and improve durability. Proper wave management and looking for opportunities to roam or secure kills with R can increase the chances of countering Sion."

    "loses": {
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses high mobility and DPS, excelling at avoiding Sion's skills. In particular, he can dodge Sion's Q with his E while dealing damage with a short Q→AA, making it easier to gain an advantage in early harassment. Additionally, by positioning himself to avoid Sion's E (knock-up), he can negate Sion's CC and increase his opportunities to attack.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important to use E to dodge Sion's Q while dealing damage with a short Q→AA to chip away at Sion's health. After level 6, while being cautious of Sion's full combo, look for the right timing to use R to either dodge or engage. It is also crucial to manage the wave by pushing it towards the enemy tower or freezing it, while securing vision to deter Sion's R roam. Focus on building critical strike and survivability to gain an edge in mid-game skirmishes.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has powerful percentage damage against tanks, allowing her to deal damage while ignoring Sion's high durability. Additionally, by using Gwen's W, the Hallowed Mist, she can easily avoid Sion's attacks, giving her high survivability in team fights. Furthermore, Sion's skills have a slow activation time, which allows Gwen to utilize her mobility to dodge skills while attacking.\n\nTo take advantage, wave management is crucial. When Sion clears the wave under the tower, freezing the wave can apply pressure on him. By prolonging the time enemy minions attack your minions under the tower, it becomes easier to freeze the bounce. Next, if Sion uses his ultimate, look for an opportunity to use your own ultimate to attack again. By using potions to maintain the freeze and crashing a large wave into the tower just before the enemy wave arrives, you can create a favorable situation against Sion.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and can deal significant damage even with a tank build, making him strong in prolonged fights. Sion has strong harassment in the early game, but Mundo can farm minions with his Q while avoiding Sion's attacks. Additionally, Mundo's passive allows him to negate hard crowd control, making it difficult for Sion to land his CC. Furthermore, by preparing items that hinder Sion's healing early on, Mundo can disrupt Sion's recovery.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important not to force attacks in the early game, prioritize CS with minions, and avoid Sion's Q. Harassing with Q while securing last hits and using W to remove slows can be effective in creating short trades. By being cautious of Sion's CC and R range, and trading after he uses his skills, you can gain the upper hand. After level 6, you can endure outside the tower and use R or TP to participate in skirmishes or team fights, leveraging Mundo's strengths.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has high burst damage and can effectively use crowd control to fight favorably against Sion. Riven's skills can be maximized by using them in succession, and by attacking while managing Sion's skill cooldowns, she can chip away at Sion's durability. Additionally, Riven has high mobility, making it easier to dodge Sion's skills, allowing her to gain the upper hand in damage trades.\n\nTo take advantage, first, keep the minions small during the laning phase and avoid being pushed too hard by Sion. Save your dash to avoid Sion's Q, and counterattack when he uses his full Q. Specifically, mitigate damage with E while unleashing a full combo. After level 6, use R to add extra damage and respond to Sion's R or ally ganks to create even more advantageous situations. It's also important to manage vision and prepare for roams and ganks.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration and an ultimate that makes him invincible for 5 seconds, allowing him to continuously fight even when taking CC and damage from Sion. Additionally, Sion's skills have a slow activation time, enabling Tremendous to utilize his mobility to attack while maintaining distance. Furthermore, after forcing Sion to use his W (shield), Tremendous can charge in with full force, creating advantageous situations.\n\nTo gain an advantage, first farm with Q while building Fury and reduce damage with W. When taking harassment from Sion's E, it's important to use the bushes to heal with Q while dodging Sion's skills. After Sion's W is activated, charge in and attack when the shield is consumed. After level 6, while being cautious of Sion's R, conserve your own R and use it during one-on-one fights or tower dives to gain an upper hand against Sion. From mid to late game, you can push solo or split push to avoid Sion's strength in team fights, allowing you to progress the game in your favor.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and all of his skills include a dash, making it easier to avoid Sion's skills. In particular, Sion's Q deals significant damage and has a knock-up when fully charged, but Anbessa can use his dash to evade it. Additionally, Sion has a slow skill activation, which makes it difficult for him to hit the highly mobile Anbessa.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it is important to pay attention to Sion's Q charge while hitting minions to build up your passive. By engaging in short trades and baiting Sion's skills before dashing to avoid them, you can deal damage while creating advantageous situations. In the mid-game and beyond, while being cautious of Sion's R charge, you can coordinate with your teammates to keep track of Sion's position and jump into the backline with your R to deal damage. In team fights, using Sion's tankiness to flank from the side will be key to victory.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox deals high damage against Sion, and by utilizing reset-based combos, he can surpass Sion's tankiness. While Sion's crowd control (CC) skills are powerful, if Aatrox can avoid those skills, he can leverage his inherent healing and damage to gain the upper hand. Additionally, Sion has slow skill activation, making Aatrox's mobility effective for attacking.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to first avoid Sion's skills. It is especially beneficial to engage after forcing Sion to use his R or W. By dealing damage with Aatrox's Q while healing with W, you can sustain damage output. Furthermore, using E to close the distance or escape can help dodge Sion's attacks and create advantageous situations. Coordination with teammates is also important; aiming for team engages to suppress Sion can further enhance your advantage.",
      "トランドル": "Trundle has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle has superiority over Sion in the following ways. First, Trundle's ultimate allows him to steal Sion's defenses, significantly increasing his damage in one-on-one encounters. Additionally, Trundle has the ability to absorb his own armor and magic resistance, making it easier to negate Sion's tankiness. Furthermore, Trundle's E can knock back and slow Sion, limiting his movement and allowing Trundle to deal sustained damage with a Q→AA combo.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important to utilize Sion's E push by saving Q behind the minions while avoiding Sion's Q charge. Before level 6, Trundle should focus on long trades, disrupting Sion's position with E while looking for counterattacks. After level 6, as soon as Sion becomes tanky, Trundle should use his R to steal defenses and aggressively engage to create a favorable situation. In team fights, it is crucial to use R to strip Sion of his tankiness, disrupt enemy engages and crowd control with E, while creating a situation where Trundle can deal damage easily.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora can gain an upper hand in close combat against Sion. By using Fiora's W (Riposte), she can negate Sion's Q (Fully Charged) crowd control and counterattack. Additionally, Fiora's passive provides extra damage and healing, allowing her to surpass Sion's durability, making her favorable in one-on-one fights. Furthermore, Fiora has strong split-pushing capabilities and excels at destroying towers, which enables her to impact the entire map by pushing her lane.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is crucial to avoid Sion's Q between levels 1 and 3. During the wind-up of Sion's Q, Fiora can counterattack with her Q (Flash) or auto-attacks for short trades. By timing her W (Riposte) to coincide with the moment Sion's Q is fully charged, she can stun him while counterattacking. Additionally, managing the wave and freezing it near the enemy tower can create a favorable situation while avoiding Sion's ganks. After level 6, utilizing her R (Ultimate) to target vitals and aiming for a quick finish is effective. By attacking after observing Sion's W and Q, and delivering burst damage with Fiora's Q and parry, she can maintain a favorable situation against Sion.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has high sustained damage and can maintain an advantage in long fights, especially against durable tanks like Sion. Sion has a slow skill activation, and particularly his Q has a long charge time, allowing Singed to exploit this gap by using his fling to swap positions or spreading poison to deal damage. Additionally, Singed excels at proxy farming, which can pressure Sion by stealing his CS.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to start with proxy farming in the early game to steal Sion's CS. By provoking Sion's Q and then canceling it with fling, Singed can deal damage to Sion while safely escaping. After level 6, it is crucial to be wary of Sion's R while cutting vision and maintaining distance. If Sion's R is activated, Singed can escape sideways and use W to immobilize him, avoiding follow-up attacks. In team fights, Singed should aim for a flank, creating chaos with his poison's sustained damage, making it easier for his allies in the backline to deal damage.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius excels in short to mid-range skirmishes, allowing him to harass with his Q while pulling Sion in with his E to stack bleed and bring him into kill range. Additionally, Darius's passive provides sustained damage that is very effective at whittling down Sion's durability. Furthermore, Darius can use his R at level 6, making it easier to secure kills.\n\nTo take advantage, you should aim to harass Sion with his Q between levels 1 and 3 while looking for short trades involving Darius's Q. Time your E to pull Sion in and accumulate bleed stacks. For wave management, use tower pressure and freezing to safely accumulate stacks while preventing Sion from pushing and roaming. Once you reach level 6, it's crucial to have your bleed fully stacked and use your R to secure kills. Additionally, by avoiding Sion's E, you can engage in close combat without facing retaliation.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has high durability and sustain, and especially in all-out situations, his attack power and mobility increase. Sion is suited for short skirmishes and excels at dealing damage quickly, but K'Sante is strong in prolonged fights and can wear down Sion's high damage output. Additionally, K'Sante's crowd control skills are effective at limiting Sion's movements, and if he can avoid Sion's skills, he can gain the upper hand.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to maintain distance and secure healing at the start while avoiding Sion's skills. In the mid-game, utilizing the shield from W to disrupt Sion's attacks and support allies will help mitigate damage. During the decisive moments, K'Sante should use his crowd control and healing to endure and look for the right timing to counterattack. By being cautious not to get caught by Sion's crowd control while counterattacking, he can create a favorable situation.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has strong one-on-one performance against Sion. All of Mordekaiser's skills deal magic damage, allowing him to bypass Sion's tankiness and deal damage. Additionally, Mordekaiser's passive allows him to deal sustained damage, making it easier to chip away at Sion's durability. Furthermore, Mordekaiser's R can trap Sion in the realm of death, forcing a one-on-one situation and nullifying Sion's strengths in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid Sion's Q during the laning phase and to attack when Sion is vulnerable after using W. By dodging Sion's E, you can continue to attack without taking damage. In team fights, by avoiding Sion's R and using your own R to isolate Sion, you can create a favorable situation when fighting other enemy champions. This way, Mordekaiser can maintain an advantage over Sion.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo possesses high mobility and burst damage, making him strong against tank champions like Sion. In particular, Sion's skills have a slow activation time, and Yasuo can quickly engage or disengage using his E, making it easier to avoid Sion's attacks. Additionally, by using Yasuo's W, he can block parts of Sion's Q and R, allowing him to negate Sion's attacks while counterattacking.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, you should use minions to position with E and farm with Q while stacking your Tear. It's important to block Sion's skills with W and aim for a quick resolution. After level 6, while being cautious of Sion's knock-up, look for opportunities to use your own knock-up and your allies' CC to land your R. Also, by prioritizing items that provide lifesteal or armor penetration early on, you can deal sustained damage more easily. In team fights, when Sion leads the charge, Yasuo can use his R to knock up multiple enemies and unleash significant damage, greatly contributing to the team.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has burst damage and ranged crowd control, making it particularly easy to limit Sion's movements. By using Gragas's E to position himself and zoning Sion with the Q barrel, he can avoid Sion's attacks while dealing damage. Additionally, Gragas's W healing effect helps counter Sion's long trades. Furthermore, using Gragas's R to disrupt Sion's charge allows him to maintain an advantage in team fights and skirmishes.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, use barrels for zoning while positioning with E to avoid Sion's Q. After Sion uses Q, look for openings to land a combo (E → Q explosion → AA → W) to deal damage. When minions disappear, both players should be wary of roaming, and when Sion's R comes, sidestep and knock him back with R to negate his charge. In team fights, Gragas can break the enemy formation with R while Sion maintains the frontline, securing an advantage for the entire team.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia can utilize her mobility to avoid Sion's slows and charges, making it easier to aim for a quick finish. Sion's skills have a slow activation time, and it is particularly difficult to land his E and R crowd control, allowing Irelia to exploit those openings to initiate attacks. Additionally, Irelia can deal high damage to Sion by using the reset effect of her Q.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to farm minions with Q between levels 1 and 3 without overextending and taking unnecessary damage. From levels 3 to 5, position yourself to avoid Sion's E, and initiate your attack after he uses it. At level 6, be aware of the angle and cooldown of the opponent's R, and it is crucial to either create distance before charging in or to dodge with Flash. During an all-in, aim for a quick finish using the E stun followed by a Q reset, and don't forget to prepare against boots and lifesteal. As for items, prioritize Trinity Force or Divine Sunderer, and then aim for Black Cleaver or Sterak's for effectiveness."

      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Aatrox's high burst damage and crowd control (knock-up) pressure. Aatrox can deal significant damage instantly with his skill combo, and especially in the early game, Dr. Mundo's durability is not yet fully realized, making him susceptible to Aatrox's attacks. Additionally, Aatrox's skills have long animations, so even if Dr. Mundo uses his \"W - Heart of Mundo\" to negate crowd control, there is still a high risk of taking sustained damage from Aatrox.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Utilize early game durability**: Focus on avoiding Aatrox's skills and aim to drag the fight into a prolonged engagement, gradually turning the tide in your favor.\n\n2. **Item selection**: Purchasing items like \"Spirit Visage\" or \"Guardian Angel\" can enhance durability, making it easier to withstand Aatrox's attacks.\n\n3. **Lane positioning**: Always be aware of your positioning to avoid Aatrox's skills, and use bushes to avoid ambushes.\n\n4. **Team coordination**: Collaborate with your jungler and mid-laner to launch coordinated attacks against Aatrox, which can help negate his strengths.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has powerful burst damage from the early game, and Nasus's durability relies on his skills and attacks. Aatrox can incapacitate Nasus with his knock-up skill and deal high damage with consecutive attacks. Additionally, Nasus is very weak in the early game, and if he doesn't farm well, he will struggle in the mid to late game, making him susceptible to Aatrox's attacks. Furthermore, Aatrox's strong traits against less mobile opponents work effectively against champions like Nasus, who have limited means of approach.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to choose a durability-focused build in the early game and prioritize purchasing items like [Frozen Heart] and [Seraph's Embrace]. This will reduce Aatrox's attack speed and improve Nasus's durability. Additionally, being mindful of stacking Q skill while avoiding Aatrox's attacks and handling minions can help in gaining growth. By timing the W skill to mitigate Aatrox's Q skill and utilizing the R skill to increase durability, it is possible to turn the tide in long engagements.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the powerful CC skills and healing abilities that Aatrox possesses. Aatrox can pull Tryndamere in with his \"E\" and increase damage with his \"W,\" making sustained fights advantageous, especially after level 6 with his \"R.\" Additionally, Aatrox's skills have long animations, so even if Tryndamere approaches with his \"Q,\" there is a high chance that Aatrox can land his skills, putting Tryndamere in a position where he cannot attack. Furthermore, Aatrox is strong against opponents with low instant mobility, allowing him to have an advantage over auto-attack-focused fighters like Tryndamere.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to use sidesteps to avoid Aatrox's skills, especially avoiding his \"E.\" After level 6, using \"R\" at the right timing can negate Aatrox's skills, allowing for more favorable sustained fights. In terms of item build, it is crucial to purchase \"Wit’s End\" or \"Blade of the Ruined King\" early to increase damage and enhance the ability to counter Aatrox.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high mobility and burst potential that Aatrox possesses. Aatrox can deal significant burst damage using skill combos, especially by engaging after Bloodmire uses his E (Sanguine Pool), effectively accumulating damage. Additionally, Aatrox's Q (Darkin Blade) can deal substantial damage by hitting the sweet spot, making it difficult for Bloodmire to avoid the attack. Furthermore, the healing effect from Aatrox's R (World Ender) also counteracts Bloodmire's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Aatrox's Q (Darkin Blade) during the laning phase. By using E (Sanguine Pool) at the right moment to dodge Aatrox's combos, damage can be reduced. Additionally, purchasing magic resistance items (e.g., Seraph's Embrace) early can effectively decrease Aatrox's damage. Furthermore, considering healing reduction items (e.g., Blade of the Ruined King) can hinder Aatrox's healing, allowing for a more favorable engagement in fights. In team fights, it is important to maintain distance when Aatrox activates his R (World Ender) and coordinate with allies' crowd control to shut down Aatrox.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Aatrox has powerful healing abilities and high damage, making him particularly adept at dealing with Sett's sustained damage. Additionally, Aatrox's Q is a ranged attack, and if he lands the third Q, it deals significant damage, making it difficult for Sett to avoid that animation. Furthermore, Aatrox's ultimate greatly enhances his durability, increasing his impact in team fights and making it harder for Sett to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:  \n1. Instead of trying to avoid Aatrox's Q, it is important to stay close and aim to escape after the third Q.  \n2. Constantly moving back and forth can force Aatrox to waste his Q, reducing damage taken.  \n3. When Aatrox uses his E, attacking with an auto-attack and Q combo, and then countering with E+W after seeing the third Q animation can be effective.  \n4. Bringing Ignite during fights and keeping distance during Aatrox's ultimate is recommended.  \n5. Equipping items like Doran's Shield or Bramble Vest can increase durability and help mitigate Aatrox's sustained damage.  \n6. Before level 6, Sett can have an advantage over Aatrox, so actively trading in the early game is crucial.  \n\nBy utilizing these strategies, Sett can alleviate his disadvantage against Aatrox and turn fights in his favor.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has high damage and healing capabilities, especially excelling in continuous attacks. While Sion has high durability, his skill activation is slow, making it difficult to avoid Aatrox's abilities. If Aatrox lands his Q, Sion takes significant damage and is further pressured into a disadvantageous situation due to Aatrox's passive healing. Additionally, Aatrox is strong against opponents with low instant mobility, making him particularly advantageous against champions like Sion who are slow-moving.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play safely and secure CS during levels 1-3 when Aatrox is weak. Prioritizing items like Steelcaps and Sunfire, and maximizing W can help counter Aatrox's burst damage. To avoid Aatrox's Q, it is effective to not move in a straight line, instead provoking his skills and then creating distance. Furthermore, understanding the cooldown of Aatrox's passive and avoiding auto-attack trades can help minimize damage. It is also worth considering utilizing your ultimate in the mid-game to contribute to the overall victory of the team.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has high damage and healing capabilities, and is particularly good at continuous attacks. Cho'Gath has a slow skill activation, making it difficult to avoid Aatrox's skills, which makes him susceptible to Aatrox's attacks. Additionally, against Aatrox's knock-up and area attacks, Cho'Gath finds it challenging to time his skills, making counterattacks difficult. Furthermore, Aatrox is strong against opponents with low instant mobility, so he can easily take advantage of slower champions like Cho'Gath.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming and secure CS. To avoid Aatrox's skills, using W to deter his attacks and harassing with Q when there is an opening is effective. Also, from the mid-game onwards, utilizing R to leverage crowd control in team fights is necessary to prevent Aatrox's kills. In terms of item builds, it is also important to choose items that increase durability, allowing you to withstand Aatrox's damage.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has high damage and lifesteal, and his damage becomes particularly powerful after level 6. Shen can negate Aatrox's attacks with his taunt, but Aatrox's skill animations are long, making it difficult for Shen to land his skills. Additionally, Aatrox can heal by continuing to attack, often surpassing Shen's durability, especially in early trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary fights in the early game and focus on farming CS while leveling up. Using W (Taunt) to negate Aatrox's Q (Dark Steel) or E (Dark Forge) can create opportunities for counterattacks. It is also crucial to utilize R (Stand United) to support teammates and enhance contributions in team fights. In terms of item build, prioritizing items that suppress Aatrox's lifesteal, such as Sunfire Aegis or Thornmail, can improve durability.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has high burst damage and sustained attack power, and especially after level 6, he can deal damage that exceeds Warwick's healing by utilizing his ultimate. Additionally, Aatrox's skills have area-of-effect attacks, making it difficult for Warwick to approach. Furthermore, Aatrox has a knock-up ability, which can disrupt Warwick's ultimate and potentially cause him to lose his advantage in extended fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming and secure CS while avoiding Aatrox's skills between levels 1 and 5. After level 6, try to maintain distance when Aatrox activates his ultimate or use crowd control to disrupt him. In terms of item selection, purchasing Steelcaps and Death's Dance early can increase your durability, allowing you to trade more favorably against Aatrox.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Aatrox's sustained damage and healing capabilities. Aatrox can deal high damage with his Q (Darkin Blade) while maintaining durability through the healing effect of his passive. Additionally, Aatrox's R (World Ender) grants him a powered-up state, making it very troublesome for Kled when he tries to engage. Furthermore, Aatrox's skills have long animations, making it difficult for Kled to avoid his E (Javelin Toss) and W (Violent Tendencies), and conversely, making him more susceptible to Aatrox's CC (knock-up).\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to be aware of Aatrox's skill cooldowns and to look for opportunities to trade when his skills are unavailable. Specifically, utilizing Aatrox's Q cooldown to create chances to deal damage with Kled's Q (Jousting) is crucial. After Aatrox activates his R, it is effective to play carefully to avoid his powered-up state and aim for kills with E. In terms of item build, it is also important to quickly gather Kled's core items to ensure he can deal sustained damage."
    },
    "loses": {
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora possesses high mobility and countering abilities, making it easier to negate Aatrox's attacks. Fiora's passive provides additional damage and healing, which is particularly effective when taking hits from Aatrox. Additionally, Fiora can easily dodge Aatrox's skills due to their long animations, creating more opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, Fiora's ultimate is also effective against Aatrox's ult, allowing her to quickly close the distance and attack.\n\nTo take advantage, during the early lane phase (levels 1-5), it is important to conserve Aatrox's skills and retaliate after he uses them. By managing minions and blocking Aatrox's attacks with shields while maintaining distance, you can safely harass him. After level 6, it is effective to actively go for all-ins against Aatrox using your ultimate, dealing damage with Q while being cautious of his ult. By utilizing the cooldowns of Aatrox's skills, you can time your attacks to catch him off guard and create advantageous situations.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has a high ability to deal sustained damage against Aatrox, especially since he can avoid Aatrox's skills. By using Singed's W (Flip), he can prevent Aatrox from getting close and safely farm while maintaining distance. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed, making it easier to dodge Aatrox's skills. Furthermore, Singed's sustained damage can reduce Aatrox's healing, allowing him to gain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to first avoid Aatrox's Q skill. Singed can use W to disrupt the timing and utilize Flip to create distance when Aatrox approaches. In terms of item build, prioritizing \"Liandry's Anguish\" and \"Riftmaker\" is effective to enhance sustained damage and suppress Aatrox's healing. In team fights, actively engaging while Aatrox's ultimate is on cooldown can leverage Singed's strengths.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has very high poke ability in the early game and can deal damage to Aatrox from a distance. In particular, by using Acceleration Gate (E) to position himself while attacking with Shock Blast (Q), he can safely harass Aatrox from outside of his attack range. Additionally, Aatrox has long skill animations, making it easier for Jayce to create situations where he can avoid Aatrox's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively poke from the early game and chip away at Aatrox's HP. By using Acceleration Gate (E) to increase movement speed, Jayce can continue to deal damage while avoiding Aatrox's attacks. Furthermore, using Hammer Stance (W) increases his defense, allowing him to mitigate Aatrox's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack. In terms of item selection, prioritizing Muramana and Youmuu's Ghostblade will increase damage, allowing Jayce to apply stronger pressure against Aatrox.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control against Aatrox, and especially in all-out situations, his damage significantly increases. Against Aatrox's aggressive playstyle, K'Sante can evade with his E while counterattacking, and he can prevent Aatrox's dash with his W. Additionally, K'Sante's passive shield and high durability also work in his favor against Aatrox's sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, at level 1, it's important to observe Aatrox's movements and, if aiming for an early cheese, to use E to dodge his Q. When farming minions, use Q and ensure Aatrox doesn't push the wave to the tower. Upon reaching level 6, there is a high chance of winning an all-in, so bait Aatrox's Q, block it with W, and evade with E to create a counterattack opportunity. Furthermore, K'Sante scales better than Aatrox, making it easier to extend the lead by aiming for early kills. However, it's crucial to avoid all-ins when low on HP or too early.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and all of his skills include dashes, making it easier to avoid Aatrox's skills. Aatrox has long skill animations, which makes it difficult to hit highly mobile opponents. Furthermore, Anbessa has significant short-term damage output and can use his R (Public Execution) to shut down Aatrox's healing, reducing his durability.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (levels 1-6), use Q (Cunning Sweep) to dodge Aatrox's skills and look for counterattack opportunities. Use W (Disengage) to deflect Aatrox's attacks and employ E (Lacerate) for skill evasion. In the mid-game (levels 7-12), deal damage with the skill combo Q → W → E → Q while being mindful of positioning to avoid Aatrox's area attacks. In the late game (levels 13-18), it is crucial to use R at the right moment in team fights to shut down Aatrox's healing, prioritizing his elimination.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high mobility and crowd control against Aatrox, making it particularly easy to dodge Aatrox's skills during the laning phase. By using Irelia's Q (Blade Surge) to approach while utilizing minions, it becomes easier to deal damage to Aatrox with skill combos. Additionally, using W (Defiant Dance) allows Irelia to mitigate Aatrox's attacks, and with E (Flawless Duet), she can capitalize on Aatrox's skill cooldowns, enabling efficient damage output.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, it is important to use Q to approach Aatrox through minions and land skills. Use W to deflect Aatrox's attacks and time E for counterattacks. By using R (Vanguard's Edge), you can aim for kills when Aatrox's HP is low, especially in the mid to late game, where applying pressure in other lanes while Aatrox is split pushing can limit his movements and create advantageous situations. In team fights, avoiding Aatrox's skills while targeting the backline allows for more effective combat.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo's blind effect neutralizes Aatrox's attacks. Aatrox heavily relies on auto-attacks (AA), and Teemo's W can significantly reduce that damage. Additionally, Teemo can become invisible, making it easier to dodge Aatrox's skills and set up ambushes. Furthermore, Teemo's mushrooms (R) provide zone control, making it easier to limit Aatrox's movements.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to position behind minions during the laning phase to avoid Aatrox's Q. Attack when Aatrox has used his W and take advantage of Teemo's W while constantly moving to utilize the blind effect. Also, securing vision and being wary of Aatrox's ganks will help maintain a safer lane. In team fights, it is effective to harass Aatrox from the backline and reduce his attack accuracy with the blind effect.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen can easily dodge Aatrox's skills, especially his Q (Darkin Blade) and W (Infernal Chains), which gives her many opportunities to counterattack. Additionally, by using Gwen's W (Hallowed Mist), she can negate Aatrox's attacks while utilizing her R (Scarlet Slash) to reduce Aatrox's healing, thereby lowering his durability.\n\nTo take advantage, first, observe Aatrox's Q (Darkin Blade) animation to dodge it, and then counterattack with her Q (Swing Swing). Furthermore, by using her E (Snap Shadow) to avoid Aatrox's skills while continuing to attack, she can deal damage. In team fights, she can use her W (Hallowed Mist) to dodge Aatrox's attacks and deal significant damage with her R (Scarlet Slash), allowing her to turn the battle in her favor."

      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high HP regeneration and an R that makes him invincible for 5 seconds, making him very strong in one-on-one situations and tower dives. Garen has silence, but if Tryndamere uses his R, Garen loses the chance to deal damage. Additionally, Tryndamere has high mobility with his Spinning Slash, making it difficult for Garen to approach, often putting him at a disadvantage in trades. Furthermore, since Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, if Garen is forced into a prolonged fight, Tryndamere's Fury builds up easily, making Garen more susceptible to damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to endure using Garen's passive in the early game. Avoid Tryndamere's auto-attacks and maintain the lane without forcing fights over minions. Particularly, getting Tryndamere to use his R is key to victory. After level 6, Garen can fight favorably as long as Tryndamere does not use his R, so aim for short trades and avoid prolonged fights. Additionally, purchasing items like Warden's Mail and Stridebreaker early, and equipping Ninja Tabi will increase Garen's durability, making it easier to withstand Tryndamere's attacks. In team fights, it is also important to retaliate when Tryndamere approaches the ADC and force him to use his ultimate early.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere is a fighter who focuses on auto-attacks and has high HP regeneration and invulnerability with his ultimate. This allows him to outlast Yasuo's short burst damage in prolonged fights, especially after Yasuo uses his ultimate, as Tryndamere can activate his own ultimate, leaving Yasuo with no opportunity to counterattack. Additionally, Tryndamere can close the distance with his E and deal damage while avoiding Yasuo's attacks, making Yasuo prone to unfavorable situations in close combat.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to chip away at Tryndamere with Q in the early game to prevent him from building up rage. Also, using minions to safely approach with E allows Yasuo to avoid Tryndamere's attacks while dealing damage. Furthermore, using W to stop Tryndamere's skills while receiving support from the jungler can be effective. After level 6, it is crucial to be aware of knock-ups and to time Yasuo's ultimate effectively, while in team fights, it is important to force Tryndamere to use his ultimate. As for items, purchasing armor early and having QSS or PD can effectively increase survivability.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high HP regeneration and increased critical strike chance, making him strong in prolonged fights, especially with auto-attacks when he has built up Fury. While Shen is strong in short trades with his E's taunt and W's shield, it is difficult for him to counter Tryndamere's sustained damage and healing. Additionally, Tryndamere's ultimate increases the likelihood that Shen will face a counterattack even if he successfully lands a taunt with his E.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid pushing the wave and instead group the minions to prevent Tryndamere from building up Fury. Taunting him with E when his Fury is low and attacking with short Q and auto-attacks can help reduce his damage. Utilizing jungle ganks and your own R to disrupt Tryndamere's all-in attempts and assist allies can also be effective. Building tankier items to increase durability and securing crowd control can improve survival rates in team fights and one-on-ones.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Tryndamere has high sustain and an invulnerable ultimate, making him strong in prolonged fights. Tryndamere's healing from his Q and his damage in close combat with his E are also threats. Especially when Tryndamere reaches level 6 and can use his ultimate, Yone has to be very cautious when trying to engage. Furthermore, Tryndamere has little crowd control, making it easier for him to dodge Yone's skills, which increases the risk of taking damage in return.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force engagements before level 6 and to manage Tryndamere's rage. Attacking from a distance with Q and safely countering with W allows Yone to deal damage while avoiding Tryndamere's attacks. Additionally, using R when Tryndamere's ultimate is unavailable to aim for a decisive blow is effective. In terms of items, equipping boots, magic resistance, and healing reduction will make it easier to counter Tryndamere.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high burst damage and becomes immortal for 5 seconds with his ultimate (R), making him strong in all-ins during short trades. While Dr. Mundo is durable, he lacks crowd control and can quickly lose a significant amount of HP when attacked by Tryndamere. Additionally, Tryndamere can increase his critical strike chance using Fury, making it very difficult to face him when he is well-equipped.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, first, play safely in the early game, prioritizing health recovery with minions while poking with Q. When Tryndamere engages with his E, it is important to request support from your jungler. From levels 3 to 6, aim for extended trades, using W to heal while chipping away with Q. After level 6, be cautious of Tryndamere's R, and coordinate with your teammates to secure kills when he uses his R or is on cooldown. In team fights, absorb damage on the front line and ensure that your teammates can use their crowd control to stop Tryndamere even if he focuses on you. Prepare anti-healing items (like Bramble Vest or Mortal Reminder) and maneuver carefully without getting too close.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high HP regeneration and his ultimate (Undying Rage), making him very strong in one-on-one situations and tower dives. Ornn requires preparation to apply crowd control (CC) and has low mobility, making him susceptible to Tryndamere's attacks. Additionally, Tryndamere can negate Ornn's CC, making it difficult for Ornn to gain an advantage. Furthermore, since Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, it is crucial for Ornn to time his CC effectively, but it becomes very dangerous when Tryndamere's Fury builds up.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS during the laning phase and maneuver in a way that prevents Tryndamere from building up his Fury. By using Q (Steel Tempest) to interrupt Tryndamere's auto-attacks, you can gain an advantage in damage trades. It is also essential to use E (Searing Charge) to CC Tryndamere and time your defenses against his attacks. In terms of item build, purchasing heavy armor items early on and ensuring physical resistance can help reduce Tryndamere's damage. In team fights, avoid isolating Tryndamere and work with your teammates to utilize CC, which can help suppress his strength.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere's high HP regeneration and his ultimate (R), which makes him invincible for 5 seconds, make him very strong in one-on-one situations and tower dives. Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, and while he can be easily damaged by Irelia's skills (Q, W, E), if Tryndamere has built up Fury, he can retaliate powerfully. Additionally, Tryndamere has little crowd control, making it easier for him to avoid Irelia's stun (E), which makes it difficult for Irelia to gain an advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. Play aggressively: It's important to trade before Tryndamere builds up Fury and deal damage early.\n2. Armor selection: Taking armor quintessences can reduce Tryndamere's damage, and buying cloth armor early to aim for Ninja Tabi is advisable.\n3. Maintain lane pressure: Since Tryndamere can quickly destroy towers, it's crucial to keep lane pressure and prevent him from split-pushing.\n4. Timing of trades: After level 6, look for opportunities to attack when Tryndamere's ultimate is down, and use minions to avoid all-ins.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Irelia can more easily counter Tryndamere.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere becomes immortal for 5 seconds after using his ultimate R at level 6, increasing his strength in one-on-one fights. Rumble only has a slow as crowd control and cannot completely stop Tryndamere's engage, making it very dangerous if Tryndamere attacks after using his R. Additionally, Tryndamere has high HP regeneration, giving him an advantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, since Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, even if Rumble harasses him with skills, Tryndamere may retaliate while healing.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS as much as possible between levels 1 and 5 and avoid Tryndamere's harassment. Proper heat management is essential to avoid overheating, allowing for continuous skill usage. After level 6, it is necessary to time the use of R carefully and maneuver to avoid Tryndamere's R. Additionally, purchasing Zhonya early can temporarily negate Tryndamere's attacks and create opportunities for counterattacks.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere can easily pressure Sion from level 1 and can use his E to avoid Sion's passive. Tryndamere has high HP regeneration and the ability to become invulnerable with his Undying Rage, giving him great sustain in one-on-one fights. When Sion attempts to engage in team fights, he can find himself in a disadvantageous situation if he takes damage from Tryndamere. Additionally, Tryndamere scales well from mid to late game and has the power to overwhelm other champions as a hyper-carry. While Sion has plenty of crowd control, Tryndamere can negate its effects with his Undying Rage, making it difficult for Sion to fight effectively in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to refrain from attacking early and to use skills to protect oneself. Trying to force attacks can lead to losing CS, so careful positioning is necessary. Furthermore, if Tryndamere uses his E, it creates an opportunity for a counterattack, making it effective to coordinate with the jungler for an ambush. Additionally, considering strategies like using Hullbreaker to push Tryndamere back to the tower or having Teleport to gain an advantage is advisable. Choosing early items like Bone Plating or Warden's Mail is beneficial, and rushing Frozen Heart can improve durability. It is crucial not to engage when Tryndamere is at full rage.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Tryndamere has his ultimate (R) at level 6, making him immortal for 5 seconds, which can negate Fiora's burst damage. Additionally, Tryndamere has high HP regeneration, allowing him to fight while healing from Fiora's damage. Furthermore, by using Tryndamere's E (Spinning Slash) to avoid Fiora's W (Riposte), he can negate her counterattack. Fiora has limited crowd control and relies on Tryndamere's auto-attacks, making her vulnerable in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase Executioner's Calling early in the game to reduce Tryndamere's healing. In lane, focus on safely taking vitals while poking, and by predicting Tryndamere's E, you can save your W to block damage. After level 6, it is effective to avoid engaging aggressively during Tryndamere's R, deal damage with short combos, manage the sides, and coordinate with teammates in fights.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high HP regeneration and an ultimate that makes him invincible for 5 seconds, making him particularly powerful in 1v1 fights after level 6. Urgot has a short range and finds it difficult to counter Tryndamere's sustained damage and healing, putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Additionally, Urgot's skills are highly dependent on levels, and if he falls behind early, it can be hard to recover, so it's important to apply early pressure on Tryndamere.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, Urgot should focus on increasing early game pressure and pushing Tryndamere back. Specifically, building items like Ninja Tabi, Randuin's Omen, and Frozen Heart is crucial to keep trades with Tryndamere short. Furthermore, Urgot can counter Tryndamere's ultimate by using his own ultimate at the right timing. In team fights, it's important to prioritize Urgot's role and protect the carries. Additionally, when Tryndamere attempts to split push, maintaining map awareness and buying time is essential.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has a very powerful ultimate (R) after level 6, making him immortal for 5 seconds, which reduces the effectiveness of Olaf's attacks. Additionally, Tryndamere has high HP regeneration capabilities and excels in sustained combat, often healing back the damage Olaf deals. Furthermore, Tryndamere has strong split-pushing abilities, which poses a risk of leaving lanes unattended when Olaf participates in team fights. Olaf only has a slow CC, and if Tryndamere escapes with his E, it becomes difficult for Olaf to engage, resulting in a lower win rate in one-on-one encounters.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to disrupt Tryndamere's CS from level 1 and build a gold lead. In terms of item selection, prioritizing Steelcaps and choosing items like Warden's Mail, Stridebreaker, or Death's Dance based on the situation can enhance durability. After level 6, it is effective to avoid getting close during Tryndamere's R and to kite while maintaining distance to attack. By considering the cooldown of Tryndamere's ultimate and timing the use of Olaf's R accordingly, you can alleviate his strength.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high burst damage and can force an all-in with his R (invulnerability), making it difficult for Yorick to deal with his attacks. In particular, Tryndamere's E gives him strong escape and chase potential, and Yorick's pet (Mistwalker) can be easily taken down. Additionally, Tryndamere increases his critical strike chance with Fury, making it hard to drag the fight into the late game, and Yorick's damage becomes less effective against Tryndamere's healing abilities.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky trades from the early game and maintain the lane while securing CS. Buying Bramble early can help reduce Tryndamere's healing, thereby diminishing his strengths. Furthermore, by cutting off the lane with W and dealing small damage with E→Q, you can summon Maiden at the moment Tryndamere engages, allowing you to turn the fight in your favor. Re-engaging after Tryndamere's R has expired will enable you to fight more safely.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high HP regeneration and an ultimate that makes him invulnerable for 5 seconds, giving him very high sustain in one-on-one fights. Set has limited mobility options, making it difficult to suppress Tryndamere's healing from his Q, which puts him at a disadvantage in prolonged engagements. Additionally, Tryndamere has little crowd control, so even if Set uses his W or E, he may give Tryndamere an opportunity to counterattack. Furthermore, Tryndamere excels at split-pushing, making it hard for Set to create advantageous situations in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play aggressively in the early game to draw out Tryndamere's ultimate. By conserving E and R, and using crowd control to trade when Tryndamere activates his ultimate, you can suppress his healing. Additionally, opting for an armor-focused build (such as Steelcaps or Warden's Mail) can reduce Tryndamere's damage and increase your survivability. Furthermore, using Ignite can also be effective in reducing Tryndamere's healing.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tryndamere has high HP regeneration and an ultimate that makes him invulnerable for 5 seconds, giving him very high sustain in one-on-one fights. K'Sante can control Tryndamere using crowd control, but after Tryndamere uses his ultimate, K'Sante's attacks become less effective. Additionally, Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, so once he is fully equipped, his damage output can increase significantly, threatening K'Sante's durability. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range and often finds himself in situations where he is vulnerable to Tryndamere's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase Bramble Vest early to reduce Tryndamere's healing. Also, using your ultimate after Tryndamere's ultimate can allow you to time your counterattack during his invulnerability. In lane, it is effective to prioritize farming rather than forcing trades and to call for jungle assistance to create advantageous situations. In team fights, it is crucial to focus on splitting Tryndamere and to coordinate with allies to surround him."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and crowd control, making it easier to create favorable situations against Tryndamere, especially in the early lane phase. Since Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, Warwick can reduce his attack speed with his E, thereby decreasing damage during trades. Additionally, Warwick's Q healing effect helps maintain HP during extended fights with Tryndamere. Furthermore, Warwick's R can negate Tryndamere's ultimate, allowing you to create a guaranteed advantageous situation by targeting moments when Tryndamere cannot use his R.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to maintain Q's healing with minions in the early lane phase and avoid prolonged fights. Slow down Tryndamere's attacks with E and trade while healing with Q. Once you reach level 6, look for a moment when Tryndamere cannot use his R to suppress him with your own R and deal guaranteed damage. Additionally, prioritize health and physical damage items to enhance sustain, allowing you to maintain an advantage in fights against Tryndamere.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high armor, making him very strong against Tryndamere's physical attacks. Additionally, Malphite's R (Meteor Strike) has a knock-up effect that temporarily disables Tryndamere's attacks and enhances his engage ability in team fights. Furthermore, by using W (Gravity Shield), which has a slow effect, Malphite can limit Tryndamere's movement and prevent him from utilizing his Fury for attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, use Q (Seismic Shard) to harass from a distance, and use E (Seismic Wave) to clear minions while avoiding unnecessary trades with auto-attacks. It's important to use W to reduce damage taken and maintain distance when Tryndamere's Fury is high, avoiding short trades. Once you reach level 6, prioritize using R in team fights and only use it in 1v1 situations when you can definitely catch the enemy. In roams and team fights, leveraging R to isolate enemies will maximize Malphite's strengths and lead to victory.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has a wide range of hard crowd control and can effectively deal damage to Tryndamere. In particular, Tryndamere is weak against crowd control, so being knocked up by Aatrox can shut down his attacks. Additionally, Aatrox's passive healing ability is very advantageous when countering Tryndamere's auto-attacks. Furthermore, Aatrox excels at continuous attacks, making it easier to chip away at Tryndamere's HP.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to initiate trades after level 3. Wait for Tryndamere to initiate, calmly assess his movements, then attack with Q and deal damage while healing with W. Use E to limit Tryndamere's movements and increase damage with R to gain the upper hand against him. It is also effective to use the minion wave to keep Tryndamere's HP low and prevent him from utilizing his passive. Being mindful of fighting near towers and using Flash to dodge Tryndamere's attacks is also a valid strategy.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn can utilize her ranged attacks to harass Tryndamere from the early game, particularly between levels 1 and 3, preventing Tryndamere from approaching and disrupting his farming. Additionally, by marking Tryndamere with her E, Quinn can create opportunities to counterattack when he gets close. Furthermore, Quinn can use her R at level 6 to roam and aim for kills in other lanes, increasing her influence across the map.\n\nTo take advantage, first harass Tryndamere with ranged auto-attacks and Q between levels 1 and 3 to prevent him from building Fury. When Tryndamere approaches with his E, use W to gain vision and counterattack with Q. Once you reach level 6, use R to move to a side lane, roam to other lanes, and aim for kills. In team fights, after Tryndamere uses his R, you can engage in a prolonged battle and look for picks from the side, effectively neutralizing Tryndamere's strength.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum can counter Tryndamere with his burst damage and crowd control (CC) in short trades. With Braum's E providing a stun effect, he can limit Tryndamere's attacks and deal instant damage with his Q, making it easier to create advantageous situations before Tryndamere builds up Fury. Additionally, Braum has strong pushing power from the early game, allowing him to establish lane dominance.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to deal chip damage with short combos before level 6 and engage Tryndamere before he accumulates Fury. Utilize the side bushes to execute the combo E→Q→AA→W, applying pressure on Tryndamere. After level 6, confirm Tryndamere's R before diving in with your own R to negate his invulnerability and either stop him with CC or lead him under the tower. In team fights, it is effective to either suppress Tryndamere first or use a split-push strategy to destroy towers.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage and can stun enemies with her E, allowing her to deal significant damage before forcing Tryndamere to use his R, which grants him immortality. Additionally, Camille's W healing effect can suppress Tryndamere's Q healing, giving her an edge in sustained fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it's important to refrain from harassing when Tryndamere's Fury is high and to chip away at him from the outside of W. After Tryndamere uses his E, you can engage with the combo E→Q→AA→Q2→W to deal damage. After level 6, use Camille's R to surround Tryndamere and aim for a burst using the stun. However, it's crucial to check Tryndamere's R and either continue attacking after he uses it or spread out your damage to avoid it. In prolonged fights, Tryndamere gains the advantage, so equip Bramble and armor, and avoid a sustain battle.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has infinite scaling with his Q and high toughness, allowing him to utilize his mobility in mini Gnar form to avoid Tryndamere's attacks. Additionally, Gnar's R provides powerful crowd control in team fights and all-ins, limiting Tryndamere's attacks. Tryndamere is weak against crowd control and cannot fight effectively in team fights, so leveraging Gnar's CC allows for a favorable position.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game, focus on farming minions with Q and prioritizing stacks. When Tryndamere attacks, use mini Gnar's mobility to create distance and avoid unnecessary engagements. Once you reach level 6, conserve Tryndamere's R while looking for the right timing to counter. After the mid-game, while completing stacks, it's important to participate in team fights without overextending and to aim for isolating Tryndamere.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has a high attack speed buff and enhanced basic attacks against Tryndamere, making him particularly strong against Tryndamere, who relies heavily on auto-attacks. Jax's W allows him to negate attacks, preventing Tryndamere's auto-attacks while providing an opportunity for counterattacks. Additionally, after level 6, Jax can use his R to better counter Tryndamere's ultimate. Furthermore, Jax can gain an advantage by attacking Tryndamere when he doesn't have Fury built up.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to force Tryndamere to use his E during the laning phase. This creates an opportunity to attack before Tryndamere builds up Fury. Until level 3, be careful not to let Tryndamere auto-attack and prioritize CS. After acquiring W, use it to counterattack when Tryndamere attempts to auto-attack, looking for opportunities to trade.\n\nIn the mid-game, it is crucial to attack when Tryndamere does not have Fury and to keep your distance when he does. After the third item, Jax becomes overwhelmingly advantageous, so actively look for trades after you have your items.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at long-range attacks, and his Q is particularly effective for harassment. Tryndamere is a champion that specializes in close combat, and when he gets close, he can deal significant damage, so Gangplank can whittle him down with his long-range attacks. Additionally, by using Gangplank's E (barrel) for zoning, he can prevent Tryndamere from approaching while dealing damage. Furthermore, Gangplank can cleanse crowd control and heal with his W, which gives him high survivability even when taking hits from Tryndamere.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, place E (barrel) outside the minion line and predict Tryndamere's approach to zone him while chipping away with Q. Be mindful of Tryndamere's R, and after he uses it, engage to burst him down when his invulnerability wears off. You can also call for jungle intervention, using crowd control to lock him down while he has R active, and then attack after it expires to gain an advantage. In team fights, it’s important to split him up with E (barrel) from the side and prioritize taking down Tryndamere when he doesn’t have R. By having items that inflict Grievous Wounds, you can hinder Tryndamere's healing and turn the fight in your favor.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius can gain an upper hand in early skirmishes. He can use his E (Apprehend) to catch Tryndamere, and then deal damage while applying bleed with his Q. Darius's passive provides sustained damage, and the healing effect from the outer edge of his Q allows him to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights. Additionally, Darius's R becomes available again upon securing kills, making it easier to aim for multi-kills in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use the E→Q combo against Tryndamere in the early lane phase (1-5) to stack up. When Tryndamere tries to safely farm with freezing or under the tower, Darius should actively engage. Upon reaching level 6, he can use his R to aim for an immediate kill, but he needs to be cautious of Tryndamere's R. To force Tryndamere to use his R, Darius should use E to secure his position and focus on hitting the outer edge of Q.\n\nIn terms of item selection, Darius can apply pressure while suppressing Tryndamere's healing by choosing Bramble Vest and an early Black Cleaver. Tryndamere needs to purchase lifesteal items early to prepare for withstanding Darius's attacks, but during this time, Darius can create advantageous situations.\n\nDuring fights, Darius should use E to immobilize Tryndamere, deal damage while healing with the outer edge of Q, and aim for a kill with R. Tryndamere will try to dodge Darius's Q with E and retaliate while enduring with R, but it will be difficult for him to counter Darius's sustained damage and healing.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nIn the early game, Riven can easily deal damage to Tryndamere using short combos, especially during the advantageous trades from level 1 to level 6. Riven's skills allow her to attack while moving, giving her an edge against Tryndamere's auto-attacks. Additionally, Riven has crowd control (CC), making it easier to limit Tryndamere's movements, particularly disrupting his timing when he is trying to build Fury for critical hits.\n\nTo take advantage, start by applying chip damage with a short combo of Q → AA → W in the early game, pressuring Tryndamere to prevent him from building Fury. Before reaching level 6, stacking some small damage items and purchasing a Bramble Vest to mitigate Tryndamere's healing can be effective. After provoking Tryndamere's ultimate, you can engage him, attacking with full force when his invulnerability effect wears off to aim for a kill. Furthermore, it is important for Riven to split push and control waves to maintain an overall advantage in the match.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has powerful CC (crowd control) against Tryndamere, particularly utilizing his E for knockback and Q for stun to limit Tryndamere's movements. Since Tryndamere relies on auto-attacks, being affected by CC can prevent him from attacking, creating a situation where he cannot deal damage. Additionally, Gragas has AoE damage, making it easier to deal damage before Tryndamere can build up Fury.\n\nTo take advantage, Gragas can establish dominance over Tryndamere before level 6. During this time, it is important to harass and chip away at Tryndamere's HP. Purchasing Mercury's Treads early can reduce Tryndamere's CC and allow for safer fights. Also, if Gragas misses his E, it is a chance to go all-in. Furthermore, using Gragas's R to push Tryndamere back allows him to deal damage while avoiding Tryndamere's attacks. This can neutralize Tryndamere's strengths and secure an advantage in the lane."

      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Cho'Gath's powerful crowd control skills and high HP regeneration ability. Cho'Gath's Q allows for ranged attacks that prevent Malphite from approaching, and the silence effect limits Malphite's ability to cast spells. Additionally, Cho'Gath excels in prolonged fights, making it difficult for Malphite's physical defense-reliant attacks to land. Furthermore, Cho'Gath's ultimate increases his size and HP, complicating Malphite's engagement.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to be cautious of Cho'Gath's Q and look for opportunities to engage when his Q is on cooldown. Additionally, utilizing the shield from W to absorb Cho'Gath's attacks and using E to clear minions while looking for roams can influence other lanes. In terms of item build, prioritizing HP and magic resistance to reduce Cho'Gath's AP damage is effective. Finally, in team fights, aim to engage using Malphite's R to incapacitate Cho'Gath.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has powerful CC skills, particularly using silence and knock-up to limit Jax's attacks. Jax is a fighter who relies on auto-attacks, and when he is affected by CC, he cannot utilize his strengths. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration capabilities, making him very durable in prolonged fights, which makes it difficult for Jax to deal damage. Furthermore, Cho'Gath's percentage damage and high durability from tank builds are also tough factors for Jax.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play aggressively in the early lane and trade while avoiding Cho'Gath's Q. It is especially crucial to gain a lead before reaching level 6. Additionally, by discerning the timing of Cho'Gath's skills and watching the stamp animation of his Q to dodge it, you can reduce damage taken. After the lane phase, focusing on split-pushing and farming in a dispersed manner before Cho'Gath can join team fights is effective. Moreover, completing Heartsteel can enhance your sustainability and allow you to engage favorably against Cho'Gath.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Cho'Gath's powerful crowd control skills and durability. Cho'Gath can knock up with his Q and silence with his W, disrupting Riven's skill combos. Since Riven has many mobility skills, being affected by Cho'Gath's crowd control leaves her unable to do anything, increasing the risk of taking damage instead. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and deals percentage damage, making Riven often disadvantaged in prolonged fights. Furthermore, when Cho'Gath reaches level 6, his ultimate increases his durability, allowing him to withstand Riven's burst damage, making it harder for Riven to secure kills.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important for Riven to engage in short trades between levels 1 and 5 to apply pressure on Cho'Gath. Using E to move and timing it to dodge Cho'Gath's Q and W is necessary to negate his skills. In terms of item build, prioritizing Black Cleaver, Sterak's Gage, and Death's Dance will help ensure durability while dealing damage. Additionally, utilizing roams to influence other lanes and aiming for snowballing can effectively avoid one-on-one situations with Cho'Gath.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has percentage damage and true damage, which can especially negate Garen's high HP regeneration ability. Additionally, when Garen is silenced by Cho'Gath's CC skill, he cannot use his Q ability, limiting his means of dealing damage. Furthermore, Cho'Gath has high sustain in lane, making it difficult for Garen to approach him. Although Cho'Gath's skill activation is slow, if he can silence Garen before he gets close, Garen often ends up at a disadvantage in trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to actively attack before Cho'Gath reaches level 6 and aim for an early kill. Additionally, by dodging Cho'Gath's Q, Garen can gain an advantage while denying CS. Furthermore, in terms of item build, choosing tank items can increase durability, making it easier to absorb Cho'Gath's damage. Finally, it is crucial to emphasize teamwork and create favorable situations for Garen against Cho'Gath.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and sustain as a tank, making it particularly difficult to escape after level 6 when he can slow you with his Q. Additionally, Cho'Gath's skills are area attacks, so even if Gangplank tries to harass, Cho'Gath can heal through sustain, making effective trades difficult. Furthermore, Cho'Gath has percentage damage, which means that even if you choose a tank build, you can still take significant damage and often find yourself at a disadvantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming until level 6, as Cho'Gath's kill pressure is low during this time, and choosing Kleptomancy to earn gold is crucial. Additionally, avoiding Cho'Gath's Q at maximum range is key. Acquiring boots and Trinity Force will make it easier to dodge Cho'Gath's Q, and when harassing with barrels, it is necessary to closely observe the opponent's movements to avoid having your barrels destroyed. Since poking in lane is difficult, you should be careful not to lose CS, especially when Cho'Gath's ultimate is active.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and strong crowd control, particularly with his silence, which can limit Renekton's trades. Renekton excels at using Fury to enhance his skills and gain an advantage in trades, but if he is exploited when Cho'Gath's skill activation is slow and has a large window of vulnerability, he often finds himself in a disadvantageous situation. Additionally, as Cho'Gath levels up, his ability to neutralize waves increases, making it difficult for Renekton to attack towers. If Renekton does not secure early kills, he risks losing his advantage in the late game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, Renekton can push the wave to maintain a freeze and deplete Cho'Gath's mana. It is also effective to initiate trades when Cho'Gath has used his skills and is left vulnerable. Regarding item builds, if Cho'Gath is stacking HP, it is crucial to rush a Blade of the Ruined King to deal damage while increasing durability. Furthermore, engaging in split play and creating 1v1 or 1v2 situations can allow Renekton to create advantageous conditions without participating in team fights.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath's powerful crowd control skills (the silence from his W and the knock-up from his Q) limit Singed's mobility. Singed's playstyle relies on getting close and dealing sustained damage, but when he is silenced by Cho'Gath, his ability to deal damage significantly decreases. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and sustainability in prolonged fights, making it difficult for Singed to gain an advantage. Furthermore, Cho'Gath deals percentage damage, which means that even if Singed builds tanky, he can still take effective damage from him.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following strategies can be considered. First, in the early game, proxy farming is important to create an experience gap and leverage level differences to gain an advantage. Also, to bait out Cho'Gath's skills, it is effective to avoid getting too close and instead maintain distance while applying poison to deal damage. Attacking after Cho'Gath has used his skills can help reduce risk and allow for favorable trades. Additionally, creatively building items to ensure durability while increasing movement speed can also make it easier to avoid Cho'Gath's attacks.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has powerful CC skills, particularly his silence (W) and knock-up (Q), which can limit Rumble's actions. Rumble's heat management is crucial, and if he overheats, he becomes vulnerable to silence, making him susceptible to Cho'Gath's skills. Additionally, Cho'Gath's tankiness and HP regeneration from his R tend to put Rumble at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Cho'Gath is favored against champions that specialize in armor, making Rumble more vulnerable to his attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. During the laning phase, use minions to avoid Cho'Gath's Q (Rupture) and trade favorably.\n2. Manage heat properly to maintain damage output by utilizing the Danger Zone effect.\n3. Force Cho'Gath to use his R on minions or other targets to disrupt the timing of his Feast and avoid difficult situations.\n4. In team fights, use your ultimate to control areas and prevent Cho'Gath from approaching with your teammates.\n5. Purchase Zhonya's items to disrupt the timing of Cho'Gath's Feast, allowing for a safer engagement.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and percentage damage, making him strong in prolonged fights. In particular, Cho'Gath's R increases his size and HP, enhancing his sustainability. On the other hand, Gragas has a slow skill activation, especially with the charge time of his Q, making it difficult to avoid Cho'Gath's attacks. Additionally, Cho'Gath's silence and knock-up make it hard for Gragas to cast his skills, often putting him at a disadvantage in trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to focus on short trades in the early game while avoiding Cho'Gath's skills and dealing damage. Specifically, you should use Q to clear minions while sidestepping to avoid Cho'Gath's Q and W. Also, utilizing W's damage reduction before engaging in combat with Cho'Gath can help mitigate damage, and using E to attack in conjunction with the barrel's slow and then immediately disengaging can be effective. After level 6, it's crucial to be aware of Cho'Gath's R and to pay attention to positioning during fights.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Cho'Gath's high durability and powerful crowd control skills. Cho'Gath has a strong ability to recover HP from the early game and can focus on farming while sustaining with his E. Additionally, Cho'Gath's R increases his size and HP, allowing him to maintain the frontline as a tank in team fights, making it likely that he can withstand Pantheon's burst damage. Furthermore, being knocked up or silenced by Cho'Gath makes it difficult for Pantheon to time his skills, preventing him from fully utilizing his all-in strength.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. Manage minions in lane thoroughly and look for opportunities to attack after Cho'Gath uses his skills. Particularly, after Cho'Gath uses his E, it is a chance to counterattack.\n2. Purchase penetration items early to focus on reducing Cho'Gath's durability. Choosing equipment that can deal damage from the early game is advisable.\n3. Use bushes to ambush and attack after Cho'Gath has used his skills, aiming to exhaust his abilities.\n4. After level 6, while being cautious of Cho'Gath's R, actively roam to other lanes to create advantages for the entire team.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Pantheon's disadvantage and counter Cho'Gath.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has powerful crowd control, and especially the silence from his W can hinder Yorick's ability to cast spells, making it easy for him to lose an advantage in fights. Additionally, Cho'Gath's R increases his HP and durability, which raises the risk of Yorick being counterattacked even when he tries to engage. Furthermore, Cho'Gath has area damage, which means Yorick's pet (Mistwalker) can be easily dealt with.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to avoid harassment in lane by being cautious of Cho'Gath's Q while using E to farm, and not forcing trades. Also, it is crucial to be wary of Cho'Gath's R before reaching level 6 and to focus on safe farming under the tower. Additionally, calling for jungle support can apply pressure on Cho'Gath and help regain control of the lane.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath's powerful CC skills, W (Silence) and Q (Knock-Up), restrict Irelia's ability to engage and attack. Especially in early skirmishes, Cho'Gath's ranged attacks and CC can be very troublesome, making it difficult for Irelia to safely farm CS. Additionally, Cho'Gath can deal decent damage even with a tank build and has high sustain, which could lead to a disadvantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to safely farm CS in the early game and avoid unnecessary engages. Irelia can effectively attack when Cho'Gath's W and Q are on cooldown, utilizing the reset from her Q. Choosing Mercury's Treads for boots can help reduce the impact of Cho'Gath's CC. Furthermore, around level 6, it is crucial to be aware of the pressure from Cho'Gath's R while conserving W and E to look for an opportunity to engage all at once.",
      "ナー": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and strong crowd control, particularly with his silence and knock-up abilities, which can limit Nasus's actions. Nasus struggles with managing his transformations, and in his mini form, he has low base stats, making him vulnerable to all-ins. Additionally, it is difficult to exploit the slow activation of Cho'Gath's skills, and it often leads to situations where retaliating after Cho'Gath uses his ultimate is challenging.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively harass during levels 1-3 and avoid Cho'Gath's Q. After level 6, utilize Nasus's R to negate Cho'Gath's skills and look for opportunities to counterattack. Prioritizing durability items (e.g., Spirit Visage) and choosing items with magic resistance can help reduce Cho'Gath's damage. Furthermore, strengthening coordination with the jungler to isolate Cho'Gath can also create advantageous situations.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath's skills hinder Nasus's approach. Cho'Gath's Q and E are ranged attacks, allowing him to deal damage before Nasus can get close. Additionally, Cho'Gath's W (Silence) limits the timing for Nasus to use his W (Wither), making it difficult for Nasus to reduce attack speed. Furthermore, after level 6, Cho'Gath can use his R to deal high burst damage, increasing the risk of Nasus being killed before he can scale up. Nasus is very weak in the early game, making him susceptible to Cho'Gath's ranged attacks and crowd control, and he is also vulnerable to ganks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early game, do not force an attack on Cho'Gath; instead, prioritize CS and focus on stacking Q. Position behind minions to avoid Cho'Gath's Q and E, ensuring you do not take ranged damage. It is also crucial to understand Cho'Gath's skills before reaching level 6 and to time your W usage effectively. In terms of item build, purchase equipment that increases HP and MR early on to enhance durability and reduce Cho'Gath's damage. In team fights, focus on stacking Q from the side while avoiding Cho'Gath's skills and dealing damage.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high sustain, and even if you win trades, he can quickly recover. If Camille gets hit by Cho'Gath's Q, she is likely to lose trades, especially since there is a risk of her Q2 being canceled by his silence. Additionally, Cho'Gath's ultimate increases his size and HP, making him particularly strong after level 6. Furthermore, Cho'Gath is slow-moving, which allows for potential jungle ganks, while Camille, despite her mobility, finds it difficult to counter Cho'Gath's sustain.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Cho'Gath's Q. By dodging it, you can gain an advantage in trades. Choosing a build with Grasp or Thunderlord can be effective, utilizing Thunderlord's true damage based on a percentage of maximum HP to keep Cho'Gath in check. Additionally, leveraging jungle support to aim for ganks can apply pressure on Cho'Gath. Finally, building Divine and being cautious not to feed while maintaining balance is key."
    },
    "loses": {
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage. The reason is that Ornn can chip away at Cho'Gath with his short Q and auto-attacks, and especially between levels 3 and 5, he can attack unilaterally by aiming for wall stuns with his E. Additionally, Ornn has crowd control, making it easier to support his teammates by taking the initiative in team fights. While Cho'Gath has high sustain, Ornn's burst damage and wall stuns allow him to deal damage before the fight turns into a long battle.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to focus on small, consistent attacks in lane while avoiding Cho'Gath's skills and pushing him against the wall with E. As you level up, you can combine W and Q for burst damage and coordinate with the jungle to apply pressure on Cho'Gath. After level 6, you can use your R to engage in team fights, supporting your allies while neutralizing Cho'Gath.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen excels in short skirmishes, being able to negate Cho'Gath's attacks with his E's taunt while dealing damage. Additionally, Shen's R can support allies from an infinite range, allowing him to assist teammates before Cho'Gath becomes stronger. Furthermore, Shen has auto-attack enhancements, enabling him to deal damage that surpasses Cho'Gath's HP regeneration.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, focus on dealing damage to Cho'Gath with Shen's Q while using W to block auto-attacks, prioritizing short trades. It's important to manage the minion wave and secure CS while avoiding Cho'Gath's skills. After level 6, Shen should prioritize roaming and supporting allies to diminish Cho'Gath's influence. Also, when Cho'Gath approaches, landing a taunt with E and counterattacking can create a favorable situation.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and all of his skills include a dash, making it easier to avoid Cho'Gath's abilities. In particular, by dodging Cho'Gath's W silence and Q area damage, Anbessa can consistently deal damage. Additionally, Anbessa has significant short-term damage output, allowing for favorable trades against Cho'Gath.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, use Q and E to farm while building up the passive for empowered auto attacks. Avoid Cho'Gath's Q with the dash from the passive and be careful not to enter the silence range of W. In skirmishes, it's important to perform quick auto attacks and adopt a hit-and-run strategy. Also, manage the minions well to avoid pushing the wave too much, which makes it easier for ganks.\n\nFrom mid-game to team fights, the ideal move is to use R to close in on the enemy carry, suppressing and taking them down. Since Cho'Gath's durability increases, prioritize building items like Black Cleaver, Lifesteal, and Sterak's, and choose boots based on whether you need magic resistance or armor. In prolonged engagements, avoid giving Cho'Gath stacks and HP, and bait out his Q and W before executing a full combo, as this is key to victory.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and is strong in prolonged fights. While you need to be cautious of Cho'Gath's burst damage and silence (E), Mundo fights by consuming HP and has a high healing amount, allowing him to withstand Cho'Gath's attacks. Additionally, Mundo's passive allows him to negate hard CC, making it easier to move against Cho'Gath's CC skills.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize minion farming at the start and position yourself to avoid Cho'Gath's Q and W. When Cho'Gath uses E to create a wave, it's important to maintain distance and dodge Q. In skirmishes, utilize your healing to endure and avoid short trades to maintain an advantage. At level 6, prepare to withstand damage using your ultimate, and during Cho'Gath's Feast timing, use W and R to survive. By building magic resistance and health items and addressing grievous wounds early, you can fight favorably against Cho'Gath.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and DPS, allowing him to engage while avoiding Cho'Gath's skills. In particular, by dodging Cho'Gath's W silence and R knock-up, Yone can utilize his strengths more effectively. Additionally, since Cho'Gath is a tank, his durability is limited against Yone's physical damage, especially allowing Yone to trade favorably in the early game.\n\nTo take advantage, start by using W at the beginning of the lane to utilize minions while applying pressure on Cho'Gath with Q. Avoiding Cho'Gath's Q and E should be the top priority, and if successful, it will create an experience gap. After level 6, be mindful of when to use your ultimate, and it is effective to engage when Cho'Gath uses W. Additionally, building critical strike and lifesteal early can help in prolonged fights, chipping away at Cho'Gath's durability. Depending on the situation, building MR can also help counter Cho'Gath's magic damage.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nTeemo has several advantages against Cho'Gath. First, Teemo excels at harassing from a distance, using his E (Toxic Shot) to clear minions while dealing damage to Cho'Gath. Additionally, Teemo's Q (Blinding Dart) can negate Cho'Gath's basic attacks, reducing the risk of taking damage from melee attacks while continuing to harass. Furthermore, Teemo can place mushrooms to secure vision and limit Cho'Gath's movements.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, start by using E (Toxic Shot) to clear minions while harassing Cho'Gath at the beginning of the lane. When Cho'Gath approaches, use Q (Blinding Dart) to disable his basic attacks and continue your assault. Be mindful to sidestep to avoid Cho'Gath's Q (Knockup), and after dodging it, unleash your full harassment. After level 6, pay attention to Cho'Gath's R (Increased Size and HP) and manage your health carefully while placing mushrooms in the lane to secure an escape route if you get caught. In team fights, avoid diving into the frontline; instead, create zones with mushrooms and focus on harassing Cho'Gath after he uses his Q, or coordinate attacks with your teammates.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen can leverage her strengths in close combat against Cho'Gath. Although Cho'Gath has knock-up (Q) and silence (W), his skill activation is slow and has a large window of vulnerability, allowing Gwen to engage when she uses E (Hallowed Mist) to become untargetable. Additionally, Gwen deals percentage damage and true damage, making her effective against the tanky Cho'Gath.\n\nTo gain the advantage, focus on short trades using Q in the early lane phase, prioritizing farming without forcing engagements. It's important to conserve Cho'Gath's Q and W, and after he uses his skills, use E to move in and attack quickly. After level 6, utilize R to increase damage and secure the advantage by dragging the fight into a longer engagement. Especially when Cho'Gath is at low HP, you can reliably finish him off with R, so be sure not to miss that opportunity.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control (CC), and his skill set is particularly effective in matchups against other tanks. By using K'Sante's Q and W to limit Cho'Gath's movements, and utilizing the stun and knockback from his E, it becomes easier to negate Cho'Gath's attacks. Additionally, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in all-out situations, giving him strong one-on-one capabilities, allowing him to maintain an advantage over Cho'Gath.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to avoid Cho'Gath's Q in the early game. Use Cho'Gath's E to engage in short trades and deal damage with Grasp's auto attacks. After level 6, be mindful of Cho'Gath's ultimate cooldown and actively engage during its downtime. It is also important to purchase Iceborn Gauntlet as the first item to enhance durability while dealing damage. When Cho'Gath is pushing, consider using minions to receive support from the jungler. In team fights, focus on pushing back Cho'Gath and only deal damage when necessary to gain an advantage in the battle.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has an R that negates CC, allowing him to attack while nullifying Cho'Gath's CC skills (knock-up and silence). Additionally, Olaf has a trait that increases his attack speed and lifesteal as his HP decreases, making him strong in short skirmishes. Cho'Gath has a slow skill activation and large openings, so when Olaf approaches to attack, it becomes difficult for Cho'Gath to counter.\n\nTo take advantage, Olaf should harass with Q in the early game while securing healing with W and using E to clear minions. Once he reaches level 6, he can use R to approach without fear of Cho'Gath's Q or W, aiming for a quick finish with E's true damage. It is also important to secure vision around dragons and side lanes to avoid numerical disadvantages when junglers gank. When Cho'Gath approaches, using R to negate CC and initiate an attack can create a favorable situation.",
      "セト": "Set has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Set has a high ability to deal sustained damage against Cho'Gath, especially by utilizing the shield from his W to force trades. When Set is silenced by Cho'Gath's W, he temporarily cannot use his skills, but he can still deal damage in subsequent trades by using his empowered Q attack. Additionally, Cho'Gath's skill activation is slow and has a large window of vulnerability, giving Set many opportunities to close in and attack.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to bait out Cho'Gath's skills first. After Cho'Gath uses his Q or W, wait a few seconds and then approach with E to trade. This allows Set to deal damage while Cho'Gath's skills are on cooldown. Also, once you reach level 6, it is effective to use a thick wave to attempt a dive. By pushing Cho'Gath out of the CS and experience range and preventing his healing, you can further enhance your lane dominance.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora possesses high mobility and strength in 1v1 situations, allowing her to trade effectively while dodging Cho'Gath's skills. In particular, Fiora can target VITALs with her Q, dealing additional damage while healing, which enables her to outpace Cho'Gath's sustain. Additionally, by parrying Cho'Gath's CC with her W, she can inflict a stun and create an even more advantageous situation.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be cautious of Cho'Gath's W and Q in the early lane phase while trading in small bursts. By attacking after Cho'Gath has used his skills, you can aim for a quick resolution. Also, keep an eye on the minimap; if Cho'Gath is stacking with his R, you need to be careful. In terms of item selection, utilizing magic resistance, armor penetration, and lifesteal can effectively bridge the durability gap. In team fights, it is crucial to leverage Fiora's split-pushing ability and maneuver in a way that prevents Cho'Gath from responding in a 1v1.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has a high ability to avoid Cho'Gath's skills, especially by dodging his Q, allowing him to initiate favorable trades. Additionally, Mordekaiser's passive provides sustained damage, and his R can force a 1v1 situation, making him very strong against Cho'Gath. Furthermore, Mordekaiser has a shield against Cho'Gath's CC skills, giving him high durability and allowing him to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to first avoid Cho'Gath's E. After dodging E, you can deal damage with Q while using W to increase your movement speed and initiate trades. The timing of using R is also important; activating it after Cho'Gath uses his CC can trap him in the afterlife, allowing you to fight favorably in a 1v1 situation. As for item builds, prioritizing Liandry's and Rylai's is effective for dealing sustained damage while limiting Cho'Gath's movement. During combat, always be aware of W's cooldown and manage it to create more advantageous situations.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox has high damage and healing capabilities, and is particularly good at whittling down Cho'Gath's durability. While Cho'Gath is weak in the early game, he becomes powerful as he scales, but Aatrox can suppress that growth by taking an early lead. Additionally, Cho'Gath's skills have a slow activation time, allowing Aatrox to exploit those openings to attack.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to land Q early to harass and reduce Cho'Gath's HP. Furthermore, by disrupting his CS to make him consume mana and forcing him to use his skills, you can trade more favorably. Utilizing poke under the tower and aggressively attacking when the enemy jungler is not nearby can maximize Aatrox's strengths.\n\nIn the late game, it is crucial to pay attention to Cho'Gath's items and skills while creatively positioning yourself to avoid his attacks. Aatrox can engage in trades using his skills and adopt a strategy to avoid Cho'Gath's strength, leading to victory."

    "name": "ヴェイン",
    "beats": {
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has high mobility and can easily dodge Warwick's attacks. In particular, by using Vayne's E to knock enemies into walls, she can restrict Warwick's movement and deal damage. Additionally, Vayne can deal guaranteed damage with her third attack, making her especially dangerous when Warwick's HP is low. Furthermore, Warwick has a short range, making it easy for him to lose trades against Vayne's attacks, and it's difficult to counter her mobility in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to prioritize safe farming in the early game without forcing trades. Warwick should use his Q to heal while trying to avoid Vayne's attacks. Additionally, utilizing the position of minions to approach with R and create situations where Vayne cannot use walls is effective. After level 6, while being cautious of Vayne's R, aim to use your R at the right timing to secure a kill.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Vayne's high mobility and kill potential. Vayne can evade Braum's attacks using her Q for dodging and her E for wall stun, taking advantage of Braum's short-range attacks. Additionally, by dragging the fight into a prolonged engagement, Vayne can quickly eliminate Braum once she has her items. Furthermore, Braum's main skills are short-range, making him particularly weak against champions with mobility like Vayne in team fights or against ranged opponents.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early game, do not push unnecessarily and prioritize minion control to hinder Vayne's farming.\n2. Purchase Bramble Vest or Ninja Tabi early to reduce Vayne's damage.\n3. After level 6, use your R when Vayne's Flash is down to aim for a short-term burst kill.\n4. In team fights, stick to Vayne and restrict her positioning to limit her mobility.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Vayne's high mobility and evasion capabilities. Vayne can avoid attacks while creating distance with her E against Darius, who has a short range, and especially after level 6, she can use her R to gain an advantage in sustain fights. Additionally, Vayne can position herself and attack with her Q before taking damage from Darius, making it difficult for him to close the gap. Furthermore, Vayne can avoid Darius's CC, making it hard for him to engage in long trades, which he excels at.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, avoid unnecessary engagements and focus on using minions to dodge Vayne's attacks.\n2. Time your E to pull Vayne in, and when using Flash to close the gap, make sure to avoid her skills.\n3. Purchase items early and build tank items to increase durability and fulfill your role in team fights.\n4. If you are in a position prone to ganks, coordinate with your jungler to create opportunities to catch Vayne.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, you can mitigate Darius's disadvantage and improve your performance in the matchup.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has high mobility and chasing ability against Jax, who has a short range, making her particularly strong in one-on-one combat. Vayne's E allows her to effectively dodge and counterattack, making it difficult for Jax to land his attacks. Additionally, Vayne has a high ability to deal true damage proportional to her maximum HP, which is powerful against tanks and juggernauts, but Jax has low base health and defenses, and is highly reliant on items, making it hard to recover if he falls into a disadvantageous situation early on.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively trade after level 3. Approaching Vayne with Q, attacking with W, and then using the cooldown of Vayne's E to engage again can be effective. If you have Flash, it is crucial to time its use to avoid Vayne's attacks and secure an escape route. Furthermore, bringing Ignite or Ghost can increase the chances of bursting Vayne in short trades.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has high mobility against Sett, who has a short range, making it easy for her to disrupt his approach. By using Vayne's E (Tumble), she can dodge Sett's attacks while counterattacking. Additionally, Vayne is strong against champions with targeted crowd control, which can hinder Sett's ability to get close. Furthermore, Vayne can deal high damage in team fights, making it difficult for Sett if he gets caught once.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Adopt a waiting stance**: Time your approach for when Vayne is about to engage, and avoid forcing a close encounter. It’s especially good to engage when Vayne's E is on cooldown.\n2. **Item build**: Purchase Bramble Vest and Ninja Tabi early to reduce Vayne's damage. This allows for sustained trading.\n3. **Coordinate with the jungle**: Request a gank from your jungler to eliminate Vayne early, reducing lane pressure.\n4. **Skill usage**: Utilize Sett's W (Shield) to mitigate damage when taking hits from Vayne. Also, use E (Catch) to look for opportunities to catch Vayne.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, Sett can alleviate his disadvantage against Vayne and play more favorably.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has high mobility and chasing ability, making her particularly strong in one-on-one combat. Urgot has a short range and long skill cooldowns, so if Vayne can frequently dodge his Q, his opportunities to deal damage are reduced. Additionally, if Urgot is knocked back by Vayne's E, he becomes more susceptible to attacks, especially when Vayne uses her ultimate, leaving Urgot vulnerable. Furthermore, Vayne deals significant damage to tanks, which means Urgot's durability is not effectively utilized.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Actively harass between levels 1 to 3 to secure an early lane advantage and put pressure on Vayne.\n2. Strengthen coordination with the jungler to gank Vayne and suppress her growth.\n3. Utilize bushes to limit Vayne's vision and set up ambushes.\n4. Wait for Vayne to use her Q to trigger her E, causing her to waste her skill.\n5. If Vayne uses her ultimate, avoid fighting and maintain distance to minimize damage.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Urgot can alleviate his disadvantage and turn the match in his favor.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has powerful damage in the late game and possesses advantageous traits against tanks and juggernauts. While Riven can dominate in short skirmishes early on, in prolonged fights, Riven is likely to be pressured due to Vayne's guaranteed damage proportional to her maximum HP and high mobility. Additionally, Vayne's E (Condemn) stun effect can negate Riven's blink and combos, making it difficult for her to engage. Furthermore, Riven is weak against immobilizing crowd control, so there is a risk of being unable to do anything if she gets hit by Vayne's skills.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early game, focus on safely farming behind minions rather than aggressively attacking, and try not to waste Riven's skills.\n2. Before reaching level 6, time the use of Riven's R to trigger Vayne's E and then execute a full combo.\n3. In terms of item selection, purchase items like Black Cleaver or Sterak's Gage early to increase durability and reduce Vayne's damage.\n4. In team fights, prioritize other enemy champions instead of targeting Vayne, and aim to avoid her attacks.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has high mobility and chasing ability, making her very strong in one-on-one combat. Nasus is weak in the early game and needs to prioritize minions to stack his Q, while Vayne can chip away at Nasus with short trades. Additionally, by using Vayne's E (Condemn) to immobilize Nasus, she can make it difficult for him to approach and deal damage with combos utilizing walls. Nasus is vulnerable to crowd control, especially to targeted skills, making him susceptible to Vayne's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Nasus to avoid risky trades in the early lane and prioritize CS to stack his Q. He should also use W (Wither) appropriately to limit Vayne's movement and assist with minion clearing or trades using E. As for items, purchasing Sheen or Frozen Heart early can increase his durability, improving his survivability in team fights and during the lane. Choosing Flash and TP as summoner spells allows him to return after pushing to continue stacking.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Vayne's high mobility and evasion capabilities. Vayne can use her Q to dodge Illaoi's attacks and easily avoid her E (grab). Additionally, Vayne's W percentage damage is very effective at whittling down Illaoi's durability. Furthermore, Vayne has a long range, making it easy for her to harass Illaoi from a distance even when she deploys her tentacles, increasing the risk of those tentacles being destroyed. In team fights, Illaoi is also at a disadvantage due to her low mobility, making her susceptible to Vayne's attacks, especially in isolated combat situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the lane, it is important to group the minions and deploy tentacles to prevent Vayne from getting close. Additionally, timing the use of E to target Vayne after she uses her Q can increase the chances of catching her. Furthermore, purchasing defensive items early on can enhance durability, making it easier to withstand Vayne's attacks. Finally, receiving support from the jungle is crucial to apply pressure on Vayne and secure an advantage in the lane.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has high mobility and chasing ability, making her very powerful, especially in one-on-one combat. Vayne's attacks deal true damage proportional to maximum HP, which is very effective against the tanky Mordekaiser. Additionally, although Vayne has a short range, she can easily evade Mordekaiser's attacks using her dashes and stealth, giving her an advantage in close combat. Furthermore, Mordekaiser relies on close-range combat, and since the cooldown of his only close-range ability, E, is long, he is easily avoided by the highly mobile Vayne.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, selecting Second Wind and Revitalize as runes and starting the game with a Doran's Shield can help reduce early harassment. In farming, use Q and E to farm minions from a distance while being careful not to get too close. During fights, it is important not to engage Vayne in a one-on-one battle; instead, when she attacks, use Q to create distance and counterattack. Additionally, purchasing potions and wards during recalls can increase opportunities to counter Vayne by waiting for a jungler's gank. In team fights, buying Zhonya's Hourglass and targeting Vayne if she is fed can be effective. Finally, asking the jungler for an early gank is crucial to suppress Vayne before she becomes strong.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has a long range and high mobility, making it difficult for Garen to close the gap. Especially after Vayne uses her E for stealth and dashes, she can easily evade Garen's attacks, increasing the risk of counterattacks. Additionally, Vayne has the ability to deal true damage proportional to her maximum HP, which is very effective against tank Garen. Furthermore, Garen's crowd control is limited to silence, which cannot restrict Vayne's mobility in team fights or one-on-one situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Garen to choose a build that focuses on early damage and quickly eliminate Vayne. Specifically, prioritizing items like Stridebreaker or Edge of Night and employing a strategy to take her down in one combo can be effective. Also, avoiding one-on-one situations in lane and coordinating with the team to have an assassin eliminate Vayne can be beneficial. Moreover, if Garen can force Vayne to use her E, breaking her skill shield could give him an advantage.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Vayne's high mobility and true damage. Vayne has a short cooldown dash, making it easy to avoid Cho'Gath's skills, and she can play favorably against Cho'Gath, especially with combos that utilize walls. Additionally, Vayne deals damage proportional to maximum health, making her very effective against the tanky Cho'Gath. Furthermore, Cho'Gath becomes vulnerable when subjected to crowd control (CC) and is often defenseless against Vayne's targeted CC and high AoE damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to prioritize CS with E's ranged auto-attacks and to disrupt Vayne's dashes with Q. In the mid-game, aim to catch Vayne using the W (Silence) → Q combo and bring her into kill range with R. Additionally, prioritize tank items and magic resistance to secure health and MR early, allowing you to counter Vayne's true damage. In team fights, act as the frontline by using Q → W to immobilize enemies and ensure the effective use of R to lead your team to victory in battles.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail is very weak in the early game, and especially until she reaches level 6, she continues to be in a disadvantageous situation against other champions. Vayne has high short-term kill potential in the early game, can use her Q skill to position herself, and can apply pressure on Kail by repeatedly engaging in small trades. Additionally, Kail lacks hard crowd control and has a short range, especially in the early game, making her susceptible to Vayne's attacks and often struggling to deal damage. Furthermore, while Kail's ultimate creates an invulnerable state, before reaching level 6, her means of avoiding Vayne's attacks are limited, and she often cannot cope with Vayne's mobility in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to prioritize CS (creep score) in the early game and endure without forcing engagements. Utilizing sustain and potions to maintain health is necessary to farm as safely as possible until reaching level 6. After level 6, Kail gains the ability to attack from range, so it is important to use her E skill to create distance while favorably engaging in mini trades. Additionally, conserving her ultimate and using it at the right moment to absorb damage for her allies can increase her survival rate in team fights.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne has high mobility and a stun that utilizes walls, making her particularly powerful in short 1v1 skirmishes. Vayne's W (Silver Bolts) deals effective damage against tanks, so even with Mundo's high HP, he can be whittled down quickly. Additionally, Mundo lacks crowd control, making him susceptible to Vayne's E (Adaptive Dash) for evasion and attacks, especially with the threat of wall stuns. Furthermore, Mundo is weak in the early game, allowing Vayne to gain an advantage by engaging early.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary fights in the early game, prioritize CS while avoiding harassment from Vayne's Q, and be cautious of Vayne's E by maneuvering to avoid fights near walls. As for items, purchasing Bramble Vest or Spirit Visage early can be effective in increasing durability while reducing healing. In the mid to late game, it is crucial to utilize R to engage in longer fights and look for opportunities to chase down Vayne and take her down with E→AA.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Vayne's high mobility and dash ability. Vayne has a short cooldown dash, making it easy to avoid Aatrox's skills. Additionally, Vayne's harassment with her Q and knockback with her E are very troublesome for Aatrox. Furthermore, since Vayne does not have targeted crowd control, it is difficult for Aatrox to land his attacks, especially in the early game when his skill cooldowns are long, limiting his chances for counterattacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play cautiously in the early game and avoid Vayne's skills. Aatrox should use his Q to harass while trying to dodge the opponent's skills and look for counterattack opportunities. In terms of item build, prioritizing items like \"Spear of Shojin\" and \"Eclipse\" will increase durability, making it easier to withstand Vayne's attacks. In the mid to late game, utilizing R to avoid Vayne's skills while increasing opportunities to deal damage is crucial."

    "loses": {
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite is a very strong tank against AD champions, especially against AA-dependent champions like Vayne. Malphite's E reduces Vayne's attack speed, which helps mitigate her damage. Additionally, the shield effect from his W increases his durability, making it easier to survive Vayne's attacks. Furthermore, Malphite's R has powerful engage potential, allowing him to neutralize Vayne during team fights or all-ins.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to first buy \"Bramble Vest\" or \"Ninja Tabi\" early on to build tankiness. In lane, use E to suppress Vayne's auto-attacks and Q to apply slows for short trades. Avoid prolonged fights and aim for quick resolutions. After level 6, actively engage with R and coordinate with your teammates' crowd control to reliably eliminate Vayne. In team fights, prioritize diving into Vayne to secure kills or to lock her down.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nThe reason Teemo is favorable against Vayne primarily lies in Teemo's blind effect and long-range harassment ability. Teemo's Q can nullify Vayne's basic attacks, significantly reducing her damage output. Additionally, Teemo can deal damage from a distance, allowing him to hit Vayne before she can get close. Furthermore, Teemo can use mushrooms to secure vision and limit enemy movement, preventing Vayne from utilizing her mobility effectively.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, Teemo should use his Q to negate Vayne's auto-attacks while harassing from a distance in the early lane phase. By around 7-8 minutes, Teemo should use his Blast to place mushrooms in the bushes for zoning. Once Vayne uses her Q, Teemo can aggressively engage to further enhance his advantage. As for items, prioritizing Nashor's Tooth and then purchasing Liandry's Anguish or Riftmaker can increase his damage output. In team fights, it is crucial for Teemo to disrupt the backline, maximizing his strengths.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has strong range and burst damage in the early to mid-game, and he excels at harassing from a distance. Vayne has a short range and is susceptible to taking significant damage from Jayce's attacks. Additionally, Jayce can use his E to knock back Vayne, preventing her from closing the gap, which helps maintain his advantage in the lane.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, it's important to use the E→Q combo to harass Vayne while managing minions effectively to avoid her silence. Before level 6, push the lane to secure vision and roam to impact other lanes. After purchasing items, you can use Greaves to aim for a snowball effect, further strengthening your advantage in the lane.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia possesses high mobility and sustain, which gives her an edge, especially in lane trades. By using Irelia's E (stun), she can nullify Vayne's attacks and create opportunities for counterattacks. Additionally, since Vayne has a short range, bringing the fight to close quarters allows Irelia to engage favorably. Furthermore, trading effectively at level 1 is crucial for Irelia, as it can enable her to gain an early advantage if executed well.\n\nTo take advantage, start by actively trading from level 1, using Q to secure CS while utilizing her passive to deal damage. It's important to use minions to approach Vayne and create opportunities to land E. After level 6, Irelia can deal significant damage to Vayne with her ultimate, so forcing Vayne to use Flash or creating situations where she cannot use it can lead to kill opportunities. Additionally, leveraging item advantages to create favorable situations and continuously applying pressure on Vayne is key to achieving victory.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has high durability and sustained damage, allowing him to recover health while taking hits from Vayne. Particularly, by utilizing Bloodmire's W (Bloodthirst), he can heal himself while enduring Vayne's attacks, increasing his sustainability in the laning phase. Although Vayne's attacks deal high burst damage, Bloodmire can use the invulnerability effect of his W to avoid that burst, making it easier to counter.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to harass with Bloodmire's Q (Blood Strike) during the laning phase to chip away at the opponent's health. When taking hits from Vayne, use W to recover health while enduring her attacks. Also, be sure not to miss the opportunity to counterattack when Vayne uses her E (Flash) and is left vulnerable. In terms of item build, prioritize items that increase durability, such as \"Guardian Angel\" or \"Spirit Visage,\" to counter Vayne's high burst damage.\n\nIn team fights, leverage Bloodmire's sustainability to coordinate with allies and focus on attacking Vayne when she is isolated. Additionally, securing vision on the map and keeping track of Vayne's movements is crucial. By employing these strategies, Bloodmire can effectively gain the upper hand against Vayne.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has very high burst damage in the early game, especially with his strong all-in at level 2. By combining his Q attacks with auto-attacks (AA), he can deal significant damage to Vayne. Additionally, by utilizing his E, which has a targeted stun, Pantheon can restrict Vayne's movements, making it easier to secure kills. Furthermore, while Pantheon has low pushing power in lane, he can continuously apply pressure on Vayne using his short cooldown skills.\n\nTo take advantage, aim to engage at level 2, dealing damage with Q and then following up with an AA. If Vayne tries to evade using her Tumble (W), use walls or minions to land an E stun and create further opportunities to deal damage. It is also crucial to inflict as much damage as possible before Vayne reaches level 6 and to aim for kills. If a kill is not secured, it is important to roam and influence other lanes to maintain an overall advantage in the game.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn's stats at low levels are superior to Vayne's, allowing her to build a lead by playing aggressively, especially in the early game. Quinn's \"Q\" has high burst damage, and by avoiding Vayne's \"E,\" she can deal damage more easily. Additionally, Quinn has high mobility, making it easier to dodge Vayne's attacks, which gives her an advantage in one-on-one combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively harass between levels 1 and 5, dealing damage by forcing Vayne to take aggro from minions. Hitting her \"Q\" is particularly important, as attacking after Vayne uses her \"E\" allows you to avoid her counterattack. Building a lead before reaching level 6 is crucial, and using a build with PTA or Electrocute to increase damage is advisable. Maintaining lane dominance while ensuring Vayne cannot safely duel is the key to victory.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo can deal high damage in short trades during the early game, especially taking advantage of Vayne's short range to engage in close combat. Additionally, by using Yasuo's E to close the gap through minions, he can avoid Vayne's auto-attacks while charging his Q, increasing his opportunities to attack. Furthermore, Yasuo can use his Wind Wall to block Vayne's skill shots, making it easier to negate her attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, both players should play cautiously while Yasuo charges his Q. When Vayne goes for an auto-attack, it's important for Yasuo to dash through a minion with his E, hit his Q, and leave room to escape immediately afterward. By timing his movements to avoid unnecessary dashes when Vayne tries to stun him with her wall, Yasuo can safely continue to deal damage.\n\nAfter level 6, Yasuo can use his R in conjunction with his allies' knock-ups to fully engage on Vayne. Since Vayne can utilize her mobility to evade, Yasuo should avoid risky 1v1 situations and focus on positioning himself to secure kills from the outside during team fights.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at harassing from a distance, particularly by using his Q to deal damage with barrels while maintaining distance. Vayne is a melee champion with a short range, making it difficult for her to avoid Gangplank's skills. Additionally, Gangplank can cleanse crowd control and heal with his W, giving him high survivability even when taking damage from Vayne. Furthermore, Gangplank's R is a damage skill with infinite range, making it easy to assist other lanes.\n\nTo take advantage, from levels 1 to 3, use Q to push the minions while keeping distance, preventing Vayne from getting close. From levels 3 to 6, harass with barrels and adjust their placement to predict Vayne's Q. After level 6, use R for side lane assistance and roaming support, prioritizing zoning with barrels in team fights to avoid isolating Vayne. This way, Gangplank can maintain an advantageous situation while applying pressure on Vayne.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has powerful offensive capabilities in the early to mid-game, particularly using AoE damage and CC to counter Vayne. By safely farming with Gragas's Q and managing the wave with barrels, he can reduce the damage taken from Vayne's attacks. Additionally, when closing the distance with Gragas's E, applying a slow while being aware of Vayne's Q can limit her mobility. Furthermore, after level 6, he can use his R to manipulate positioning and create advantageous situations against Vayne.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, farm with Q in the early game and manage the minion wave with barrels. It is important to apply a slow before closing the distance with E to avoid Vayne's Q. After level 6, utilize R to disrupt the enemy formation and engage either solo or in coordination with allies. Also, position yourself to prevent Vayne from getting a stun off the wall, and by saving R for either skirmishes or escapes, you can create even more favorable situations.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank and can withstand Vayne's attacks. Additionally, Ornn's skills contain a lot of crowd control, and particularly the knock-up from his ultimate can limit Vayne's mobility. Furthermore, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane maintenance, and he has high HP regeneration. This allows him to endure Vayne's attacks, making it possible to turn the fight into a war of attrition.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to wait until level 3 or 4 before attempting to push. If Vayne makes a mistake, look for an opportunity to attack with W, close the gap using Q, and deal damage with E for crowd control. Also, creating Frozen Heart or Sunfire Aegis early to increase durability makes it easier to absorb Vayne's attacks. Additionally, using Glacial to utilize bushes can restrict Vayne's movements, increasing the chances for an all-in.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has a high ability to deal sustained damage, and his ultimate is particularly powerful in narrow spaces. While Vayne has high mobility, her short range and lack of AoE attacks in team fights make it difficult for her to deal with Rumble's sustained damage. Additionally, Rumble can use his skills while managing heat, allowing him to continuously attack and deal damage before Vayne can retaliate.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (1-6), use Q to engage in close combat while utilizing minions, and apply a slow with E to land Q for damage. It's important not to force an all-in and prioritize sustain. Once you reach level 6, use your ultimate in narrow corridors or brushes to create opportunities to corner Vayne. In the mid-game (6-14), utilize your ultimate around roams and objectives, being mindful of Vayne's sidesteps and changing angles while attacking.\n\nIn terms of items, prioritize AP boosts and purchase Zhonya's for safety while adjusting magic resistance and boots. In team fights, it's crucial to use your ultimate to zone Vayne and create opportunities for your teammates to engage. Since prolonged fights favor Vayne, aiming for a quick resolution is key to victory."

      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger has the ability to place turrets, giving him high zoning potential, which makes it particularly troublesome when trying to engage him up close. Heimer's W (turret) attacks automatically, and if hit by his E (stun), Rumble can take significant damage, making trades within the turret's range difficult. Additionally, Heimer has strong lane sustain and can safely farm CS using his turrets, making it hard for Rumble to find the right moment to engage. Furthermore, Heimer's ultimate enhances his skill effects, making it easier for him to put Rumble in a disadvantageous position during team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is crucial to focus on health management and aim for the turret with E before Heimer's W (turret) is deployed. By pulling the minion wave towards yourself and making it easier to destroy the turret, you can reduce Heimer's pressure. After level 6, it is important to use R to control Heimer's position and prioritize destroying his turrets. Securing vision and interfering from the jungle can also effectively suppress Heimer's turret deployment. As for items, it is recommended to core on Liandry's and purchase magic resistance items early based on the situation.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo is vulnerable to Heimerdinger's turrets and AoE skills. Heimerdinger can set up turrets for zone control and deal high DPS, but Teemo's blind effect does not affect turrets or skills, so he cannot neutralize Heimerdinger's attacks. Additionally, Heimerdinger can safely deal damage using his turrets, making it difficult for Teemo to approach. Furthermore, Heimerdinger can restrict Teemo's movement with stuns and slows from his E, creating unfavorable situations when Teemo tries to all-in.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to harass with Q before Heimerdinger sets up his turret at levels 1-2 to deal damage early. After the turret is placed, attacking from the side near minions can minimize damage taken. Also, dealing continuous damage with E while moving with W to avoid turret fire is effective. Placing mushrooms in bushes or the river to secure vision and being cautious of approaching the turret is also important. After level 6, considering Heimerdinger's R enhancement, it is advisable to avoid getting too close and to create zones with mushrooms to look for counterplay opportunities. As for items, AP Teemo should prioritize Nashor's Tooth, followed by Liandry's or Zhonya's to increase survivability.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger can use his turrets to poke and zone from a distance. Braum is a melee champion and needs to destroy Heimerdinger's turrets to get close, but the turrets are vulnerable to long-range attacks and AoE damage, making Braum susceptible to damage when trying to approach. Additionally, Heimerdinger's E ability can stun or slow, making it difficult for Braum to close the gap. Furthermore, Braum's main skills have short range, which makes him feel disadvantaged in team fights and against ranged opponents.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use minions to secure vision and time the approach with Q. Destroying the turrets early can negate Heimerdinger's zoning and allow Braum to prolong fights with W. Also, using E to time when to take damage or counterattack can create favorable situations against Heimerdinger. Additionally, considering jungle interference and placing wards to secure vision is crucial. This way, Braum can effectively approach while avoiding Heimerdinger's attacks.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger has a playstyle that involves setting up turrets, and his poke in the lane is particularly strong. When Aatrox tries to farm, he is susceptible to damage from Heimerdinger's turrets and skills (especially the stun and slow from his E), often resulting in Aatrox taking more damage than he can deal. Additionally, even if Aatrox attempts an all-in, it is difficult for him to win against Heimerdinger's high DPS and crowd control. Furthermore, Heimerdinger can apply pressure from a distance against Aatrox, who has low durability, making it challenging for Aatrox to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is effective to attempt an all-in when Heimerdinger is pushing the turret and has low mana. In the lane, it is important to farm as far away from the turret as possible to avoid poke and minimize harassment. Additionally, purchasing a Cull to farm and preparing for mid-game team fights can also be beneficial. By waiting for ganks and looking for skirmishes in the mid-game, Aatrox can increase his chances of countering Heimerdinger.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger excels at sustained poke from a distance and can prevent Darius from approaching by placing turrets. Darius is a melee champion, and if he cannot break Heimerdinger's range, he will continue to take damage from stuns with E and turret attacks. Additionally, Heimerdinger can zone Darius using turrets, applying pressure even when Darius is trying to farm minions. Furthermore, Darius has low mobility, making it difficult to dodge Heimerdinger's skills, which makes him susceptible to ambushes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Be aware of turret positioning**: Freeze the minions before Heimerdinger places his turrets to maintain the lane without taking turret damage.\n2. **Utilize roaming**: Darius can roam to other lanes and coordinate with allies to secure kills, reducing pressure in his lane.\n3. **Manage summoner spells**: Use Flash or Cleanse appropriately to avoid Heimerdinger's E and Q, preventing damage.\n4. **Adjust item build**: Purchase durability items early to withstand Heimerdinger's attacks. Specifically, choosing items with magic resistance can help reduce Heimerdinger's damage.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger excels at sustained poke and zoning from a distance. Heimerdinger can set up turrets to deal high DPS, making it difficult for Ornn to approach. In particular, Ornn needs to prepare his skills to apply CC, and if he gets stunned or slowed by Heimerdinger's E, he won't be able to engage. Additionally, Ornn has low base durability and is vulnerable to turret attacks and Heimerdinger's skills.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it's important to time the destruction of Heimerdinger's turrets, engaging with E→Q→R the moment he runs out of skills. Also, maneuvering to take vision using minions while avoiding Heimerdinger's attacks is necessary. Furthermore, choosing a build that prioritizes toughness and securing magic resistance early can help reduce Heimerdinger's damage. Finally, being wary of jungle interventions and utilizing TP to create team fights can allow Ornn to leverage his strengths.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger can place turrets and attack from a distance early in the game, making it difficult for Nasus to farm in lane. In particular, Nasus is very weak in the early game and needs to last-hit minions to stack his Q, but the pressure from Heimerdinger's turrets makes this challenging. Additionally, Heimerdinger's E ability can stun and slow Nasus, hindering his approach and reducing his chances of winning one-on-one trades. Furthermore, Heimerdinger can easily deal damage to the relatively low-durability Nasus from a distance, creating advantageous situations before Nasus can scale up.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Lane Management**: Farm minions with Q outside of turret range and avoid unnecessary aggression. It is important to safely farm minions by pulling them towards your tower to avoid turret pressure.\n2. **Item Selection**: Starting with Doran's Shield or Corrupting Potion and choosing items that increase durability can help withstand Heimerdinger's harassment. Additionally, aiming for Mercury's Treads or Sunfire-type items can improve survivability.\n3. **Ally Support**: Utilizing ganks from your jungle can help destroy Heimerdinger's turrets, reducing lane pressure. It is also important to time your Teleport to break the turret when the opportunity arises.\n4. **Mid to Late Game Strategy**: As Nasus scales up in the mid to late game, it is crucial to avoid risky trades while steadily stacking Q. In team fights, using E on the backline carries and stacking Q in the frontline can help leverage Nasus's strength.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger can set up turrets to zone her, making it difficult for Quinn to approach. Heimerdinger's turrets have high DPS, and especially in fights within turret range, Quinn is more susceptible to damage. Additionally, Heimerdinger's E skill can stun and slow, limiting Quinn's mobility and making it harder for her to engage. Furthermore, Quinn has weak AoE damage and struggles to counter Heimerdinger's turrets in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, at the start of the lane, it is important to avoid stepping directly in front of Heimerdinger's turrets and not to approach when they are set up. After level 3, it is advisable to aim for a burst attack right after Heimerdinger uses his skills. Also, managing minions and fighting outside of turret range can help avoid Heimerdinger's attacks. Additionally, utilizing roams to impact other lanes can apply pressure on Heimerdinger. In terms of item selection, choosing penetration or assassin-oriented gear and aiming to take down Heimerdinger early is recommended.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Heimerdinger's zoning ability with his turrets and his long-range attack skills. By placing turrets, Heimerdinger makes it difficult for Singed to approach, allowing him to deal powerful damage within the turret's range. Since Singed can only deal damage when he gets close, it becomes challenging to engage in front of Heimerdinger's turrets. Additionally, Heimerdinger's E ability, which can stun or slow, increases the risk for Singed when trying to get close.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following strategies can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to proxy farm behind the tower to gain experience. While avoiding Heimerdinger's turrets, look for opportunities to use E followed by a flip to throw Heimerdinger out of turret range, creating chances to deal damage. Additionally, when roaming, utilizing R to dive into enemy champions can increase your impact in team fights. Furthermore, coordinating with teammates to attack and destroy Heimerdinger's turrets can also be effective.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the zoning and high DPS from Heimerdinger's turrets. Heimerdinger fights by placing turrets, which can deal powerful damage, especially to enemies that come close. When Camille tries to close the distance with her E, she needs to avoid the turret's line of fire, but having a turret limits her movement and makes her more susceptible to attacks. Additionally, Heimerdinger's E can stun or slow her down, further reducing Camille's mobility. Furthermore, Camille lacks AoE attacks, making it difficult for her to maneuver in team fights, especially when Heimerdinger's turrets are present.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to engage quickly without destroying Heimerdinger's turrets. When closing the distance with E, maneuver to avoid the turret's line of fire and attack when Heimerdinger's skills are on cooldown. It is also effective to focus on coordinating with the jungle to create opportunities to overwhelm Heimerdinger through ganks. Additionally, being aware of turret placement and positioning yourself so that Heimerdinger cannot conserve his skills can help create advantageous situations for Camille.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger has high zoning ability with his turrets, and particularly strong pushing power in the lane. When Fiora gets hit by Heimerdinger's E (stun), she loses her chance to counterattack and becomes more susceptible to damage. Additionally, Heimerdinger can make it difficult for Fiora to approach by placing turrets, allowing him to chip away at her from a distance. Furthermore, Fiora lacks AoE attacks, making it hard for her to destroy Heimerdinger's turrets, which delays her wave clear and adds to her disadvantages.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to trade from outside the range of Heimerdinger's turrets using Q to deal damage gradually. Also, by timing Heimerdinger's E and parrying it with W (Riposte), Fiora can negate the stun and aim for a counter. Additionally, coordinating with the jungle for ganks can create opportunities to overwhelm Heimerdinger. After level 6, split pushing in side lanes while ignoring Heimerdinger's turrets to apply pressure on other lanes can also be effective."
    },
    "loses": {
      "アカリ": "Akali has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali possesses high mobility and burst damage, allowing her to use her E skill to approach before entering the range of Heimerdinger's turrets. Heimerdinger fights by setting up turrets, but Akali can avoid turret attacks with her blinks while dealing damage instantly. Additionally, Akali's smoke screen is very effective as a means to negate Heimerdinger's skills by blocking vision.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize HP and XP during the laning phase and avoid taking unnecessary harassment to earn gold. Use an early TP at levels 4-5 to maintain the same level as Heimerdinger while keeping high HP, creating opportunities for an all-in. It is important to time the E skill cleverly to approach while avoiding Heimerdinger's turret attacks and then use the R skill to deal damage all at once. By avoiding turret attacks and leveraging Akali's mobility, you can gain an advantage in combat.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo is strong in close combat and can quickly destroy Heimerdinger's turrets. He can safely approach using minions with his E and block Heimerdinger's rockets with his W. Additionally, Yasuo's Q is effective for taking down turrets, and once the turret is destroyed, he can play favorably against Heimerdinger.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first use minions to safely approach with E and block rockets with W. Then, quickly destroy Heimerdinger's turret with Q and E, and once the turret is gone, aim for an all-in on Heimerdinger using Yasuo's Q3. By engaging after seeing Heimerdinger's E (bomb), you can avoid CC while attacking. In team fights, it is important to use R in conjunction with your allies' CC to eliminate Heimerdinger.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton is a melee champion, making it easier to land his E by getting within the range of Heimerdinger's turrets, allowing for effective counterplay. Additionally, Renekton has high sustain and can negate Heimerdinger's poke by enhancing his skills with Fury. Furthermore, using Renekton's W, which has a stun, can disable Heimerdinger's crowd control and create opportunities for an all-in.\n\nTo take advantage, Renekton should stand behind the turret and engage before Heimerdinger sets up his turret. Approaching Heimerdinger with E, aiming for a stun with W, and dealing damage while at full Fury before quickly escaping is effective. Also, prioritizing Heimerdinger's turret and applying pressure before he can set it up can zone him out. Additionally, farming minions with Second Wind or Doran's Shield to gain a lead will make it easier to leverage Renekton's strengths.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen is strong against short-term bursts and can engage Heimerdinger from outside the tower using her R. Additionally, Gwen's skills provide sustain and true damage, allowing her to effectively deal damage to tanks, which enables her to play aggressively against Heimerdinger's turrets and rockets.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (1-5), you are likely to be pressured by Heimerdinger's turrets and rockets, so farm near the tower while absorbing rockets with minions. Save E for dodging rockets or engaging, and after forcing the opponent to use their skills (W/E), charge in with R. After that, aim to deal damage quickly with the Q→W→E combo, looking for a chance to take down Heimerdinger.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Heimerdinger utilizes turrets for zoning and high DPS, while Dr. Mundo has high sustain and an exceptional self-healing ability even while consuming HP. Mundo has tank-like durability, allowing him to withstand Heimerdinger's attacks while gradually dealing damage. Additionally, Heimerdinger's attacks primarily work within the range of his turrets, so Mundo can safely clear minions outside of turret range and gain an advantage as he levels up.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, it's important to use Q to safely clear minions outside of turret range in the early game while avoiding Heimerdinger's attacks. After reaching level 3, manage your HP by enduring Heimerdinger's poke and utilizing your sustain. Once you reach level 6, use your R to play aggressively, aiming to destroy turrets and initiate short skirmishes, which will give you the upper hand against Heimerdinger. Furthermore, purchasing boots early and moving to avoid turrets will help you dodge Heimerdinger's attacks while maintaining lane pressure.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and excels at engaging in team fights and lanes. Heimerdinger fights using his turrets, but Sion can approach while taking turret shots by leveraging his durability and crowd control skills. Additionally, Sion's Q can be used for minion clearing, allowing him to maneuver advantageously when destroying Heimerdinger's turrets.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning, prioritize minion clearing without forcing engagement with Heimerdinger. As you level up, it’s important to use your W for shielding while ambushing Heimerdinger with E and R. When the jungle comes, aim for a guaranteed kill with W→Q full charge, creating opportunities to destroy turrets. In team fights, step forward to tank and prioritize destroying Heimerdinger's turrets to secure an advantage for the entire team.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses high mobility and burst damage, allowing him to efficiently deal with Heimerdinger's turrets. Specifically, he can approach while dodging turret attacks with his E and then deal significant damage with his R or Q. Additionally, since Heimerdinger relies on his turrets, his combat effectiveness drastically decreases when they are destroyed.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, in the early lane phase, Yone should farm minions outside of turret range to minimize damage taken. Next, when Heimerdinger deploys his turrets, Yone can use his E to take down the turrets one by one and then close in to unleash burst damage with his R or Q. It is particularly important to avoid Heimerdinger's grenades before engaging. The optimal all-in timing is after Heimerdinger has redeployed his turrets or missed his grenade, allowing Yone to use the return of his E to deal true damage effectively. Finally, utilizing tower pressure to force Heimerdinger to roam and gaining vision to track turret positions is also crucial. Rushing in recklessly can lead to instant death, so prioritizing a plan to divide and quickly destroy is essential.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf is a melee champion and can farm outside of Heimerdinger's turret range, putting pressure on Heimerdinger. Additionally, Olaf can charge in while negating slows with his R, allowing him to attack while avoiding CC from Heimerdinger's E. Furthermore, Olaf becomes stronger as his HP decreases, making it easier to create situations where he is empowered after taking damage from Heimerdinger.\n\nTo take advantage, first farm outside of Heimerdinger's turret range in the early laning phase, using Q to auto-attack over minions to gain an edge. After Heimerdinger places a turret, aim to charge in with Q during his brief cooldown and initiate a 1v1 fight while healing with W. When entering the turret zone, use R to negate slows and focus on either destroying the turret or pushing to the tower if that isn't possible. After the mid-game, when engaging in team fights, it's advisable to jump in with the assumption that the turret will be taken down first and to focus on positioning to avoid being stopped by CC.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has sustained healing abilities and can avoid Heimerdinger's rockets and skills by using W (Pool). This makes it harder to take damage from Heimerdinger and easier to retaliate against harassment in lane. Additionally, after level 6, Bloodmire can combine E and R to attack Heimerdinger by exploiting the gaps in his turret and skills.\n\nTo take advantage, first push the wave back and farm outside the tower while recovering health with Q. It's important to learn the timing to dodge Heimerdinger's rockets and turret placements with W. Once you reach level 6, use E and R to get close to Heimerdinger and charge in when his tower or hero turret is down. Also, by choosing magic resistance items or Zhonya, you can increase your survival rate in team fights.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and burst damage, while Heimerdinger's turrets are weak against crowd control. Garen is a melee fighter and can easily disable Heimerdinger's turrets. Additionally, Garen's Q (Silence) can prevent Heimerdinger from using his skills, allowing Garen to engage before getting hit by E (Stun).\n\nTo take advantage, it is important not to charge directly at the turret but to use minions to lure and deal with the turret. While being cautious of Heimerdinger's W (Rocket), you should be aware of your positioning and line of sight. Use E (Sustain) while saving Q (Silence), and engage when Heimerdinger has used all his skills. After destroying the turret and skills, you can aim for a kill with a full combo (Q→E→R). Additionally, purchasing magic resistance early can help stabilize long fights.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen can attack without entering the range of Heimerdinger's turrets, making him less affected by them. Additionally, Kennen's ability to aim for stuns can be utilized even when Heimerdinger has placed his turrets. Particularly, by attacking while avoiding Heimerdinger's grenades, Kennen can deal damage while safely laning.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to stay out of turret range and use minions to dodge Heimerdinger's Q and W. Check Heimerdinger's skill cooldowns, then engage with E and follow up with a Q→W→R combo to deal instant damage. You can gain an advantage by attacking when there are few turrets or when Heimerdinger's grenades are on cooldown. Additionally, after pushing, being aware of roaming to influence other lanes can also be effective.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and all of his skills include a dash, making it easier to avoid Heimerdinger's turrets and skills. In particular, Heimerdinger is weak in close combat and excels at attacking within the range of his turrets, so it is important for Anbessa to avoid turret attacks when approaching. Furthermore, Anbessa has a high short-term damage output, and by attacking when Heimerdinger has used all of his skills, he can effectively deal damage.\n\nTo gain the advantage, focus on safety in the early game and farm while hiding in the minions. It is important to dodge Heimerdinger's Q and turrets with the passive dash and use E to clear minions from outside the turret range. To create opportunities to attack, engage right after Heimerdinger places a turret or has used all of his skills. By using the combo of passive → E → auto-attack to engage and building up shields with W to counterattack, Anbessa can gain the upper hand against Heimerdinger. Additionally, coordinating with the jungle to quickly destroy turrets can also be effective.\n\nIn team fights, use R to suppress Heimerdinger's backline and aim for kills with E's slow and passive follow-up right after landing. Be careful not to enter the turret zone too much, and by coordinating with your frontline allies to engage, you can maximize Anbessa's strengths.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has a powerful engage ability with his R, allowing him to destroy Heimerdinger's turrets. Heimerdinger uses his turrets for zone control and deals high DPS, but Malphite can negate turret attacks by getting close and using his R, bringing the fight to a favorable melee range against Heimer. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense, making him strong against AD champions, which allows him to withstand Heimer's attacks more easily.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it's important to farm safely behind the tower and use minions to block Heimer's turrets when engaged. The moment Heimer runs out of skills, charging in with R to destroy the turret and initiate a melee fight is effective. Also, building MR early can reduce damage from Heimer's skills, allowing for a more stable laning phase. In team fights, using R to break Heimer's turrets and your allies' backline while solidifying the frontline is essential for initiating.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes stronger as she levels up, and especially after level 6, she gains the ability to attack from range, dealing high damage. Heimerdinger has strong zoning and turret pressure in the early game, but while Kail is vulnerable in the early game, she can leverage her strengths to counter Heimerdinger after reaching level 6. Additionally, Kail's R skill grants her invulnerability, which can negate Heimerdinger's high burst damage, allowing her to perform favorably in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to focus on CS between levels 1 and 5 and avoid Heimerdinger's E skill. Instead of forcing trades, send pings to request jungle support to create opportunities for ganks. Once you reach level 6, actively attack Heimerdinger using your ranged attacks, dealing damage safely from outside the turret's range. After level 11, Kail becomes even more powerful, and it is crucial to continue attacking while using her R skill to protect allies, thereby increasing her influence in team fights. As for items, acquiring Nashor's early and then aiming for Guinsoo or Rabadon's will maximize damage output.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen is a melee champion, making it easier to land his E by getting within the range of Heimerdinger's turrets, and he can use his taunt to negate Heimerdinger's attacks. Additionally, Shen's R provides an infinite range shield, allowing him to support allies while roaming to impact other lanes while Heimerdinger is setting up his turrets.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, avoid Heimerdinger's Q and W (turret) attacks by staying behind minions and approach by jumping over walls with E. In the mid-game, it is important to destroy Heimerdinger's W (turret) before engaging. Avoid turret fire with E, then use the E→W combo to land the taunt and deal damage to Heimerdinger. After level 6, utilize R to support allies and look for opportunities to attack when Heimerdinger is busy setting up his turrets.",
      "ライズ": "Ryze has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has high DPS against Heimerdinger and possesses guaranteed crowd control. Heimerdinger fights by placing turrets, but Ryze can snare Heimerdinger with his E and then deal damage with his Q. Additionally, he can attack without entering the range of Heimerdinger's turrets, allowing him to deal damage while minimizing risk.\n\nTo gain the advantage, start the lane with extra health potions and constantly check the position of Heimerdinger's turrets. Look for opportunities to deal damage with the E→Q combo the moment Heimerdinger misses his grenade. Manage the wave to keep it neutral or slightly frozen, avoiding taking turret shots all at once. After level 6, you can reliably take down Heimerdinger by landing your snare with W and then executing a full combo. It's also important to use your R to approach safely. In team fights, prioritizing the destruction of Heimerdinger's turrets and managing vision will be key to victory.",
      "オーロラ": "Aurora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and excels at engaging and disengaging. Heimerdinger plays a zoning style by placing turrets, but Aurora can attack from outside the turret's range and harass while retreating with his E. Additionally, by using Aurora's R, he can neutralize Heimerdinger's turrets and control the area.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, be mindful of Heimerdinger's turrets while earning marks with Q and safely harassing with E. It is effective to use Q from an angle to aim for penetrating damage while avoiding the turret's line of sight. After level 6, you can use R to catch Heimerdinger and neutralize his turrets, allowing you to coordinate with your teammates to secure kills. Also, by saving W, you can retreat from dangerous situations or reset turret aggro, giving you an advantage in prolonged fights.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar can easily counter Heimerdinger, who is a champion that relies on walking to engage, within turret range. Gnar can use his Q (Boomerang) to avoid Heimerdinger's attacks while dealing damage, and by landing his E (Stun), he can limit Heimerdinger's actions. Additionally, by utilizing the high base stats and CC effects gained from Gnar's transformation, he can gain an upper hand against Heimerdinger.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, it is important not to force attacks on Heimerdinger's turret but to use minions to chip away at it. Gnar should time his W (Jump) to avoid Heimerdinger's skills and position himself cleverly to dodge Heimerdinger's attacks when fighting near the turret. After transforming, Gnar can approach Heimerdinger in Mega Gnar form, land his E (Stun), and unleash a powerful attack to deal significant damage to the opponent. Furthermore, prioritizing items that increase durability in the item build is effective to withstand Heimerdinger's damage.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank can maneuver outside of Heimerdinger's turret range, allowing him to prioritize CS while utilizing his W for healing. Additionally, he can avoid Heimerdinger's skills and deal burst damage with combos using barrels. Particularly, while Heimerdinger is setting up his turrets, he is less likely to be attacked, and Gangplank can counterattack when the turrets are depleted.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is crucial to avoid being pushed into Heimerdinger's turret at the start of the laning phase and to stay outside of turret range. Between levels 1 and 3, focus on avoiding Heimerdinger's skills while conserving W to secure CS. After the turrets are worn down, place barrels and initiate trades to create favorable situations.\n\nFurthermore, after level 6, you can use your ultimate to intervene in side lanes and assist allies. In team fights, it is important to position yourself to block Heimerdinger's line of sight, using barrels to obstruct his vision while timing your engagement on Heimerdinger himself. This way, you can maintain an advantage over Heimerdinger."

    "name": "マルファイト",
    "beats": {
      "ヴェイン": "Vayne is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high armor and strong engage ability that Malphite possesses. Malphite can poke with his Q from the early game and initiate favorable trades against Vayne by enhancing his auto-attacks with E. Additionally, Malphite's R knock-up limits Vayne's mobility and takes away her chances to counterattack. Furthermore, Malphite is a tank that relies on physical defense, making him resistant to Vayne's normal attacks and true damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, between levels 1 and 3, focus on auto-attacking from a distance and gradually whittling down Malphite with Q. Prioritize positioning to avoid getting hit by Malphite's Q and look for opportunities to stun him against a wall with E. After level 6, try to dodge Malphite's R with Flash or Q to create counterattack opportunities. Additionally, expect jungle intervention and use pings to keep track of Malphite's R position, allowing for a safer gameplay experience. Building Bramble Vest is also important for sustain against him.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite is a very strong counter to Quinn. Malphite has high physical defense and is a strong tank, especially against AD champions. Quinn primarily aims for burst damage, but when temporarily neutralized by Malphite's harassment with Q or the knock-up from his R after level 6, it becomes difficult for Quinn to utilize her mobility and damage output. Additionally, Malphite has high durability in close combat, making it easier for him to absorb Quinn's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to bully Malphite before level 6. By dodging Malphite's Q with E, you can gain an advantage in trades. Also, after Malphite uses his Q, you can continue to auto-attack during his cooldown to accumulate damage. Furthermore, after level 6, it is recommended to avoid direct confrontations with Malphite and play on the opposite side of the map. This way, you can minimize Malphite's impact while focusing on roaming and farming in other lanes.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite's high physical defense and powerful crowd control (R) make it difficult for Irelia's attacks to be effective. Malphite can immobilize Irelia with his ranged attack (Q) and retaliate with his R, putting Irelia at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Additionally, Malphite's E reduces attack speed, further limiting Irelia's ability to attack.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Utilize minions**: It's important to safely secure CS while resetting with Q on minions to avoid Malphite's attacks.\n2. **Distance management**: Always be aware of distance to avoid Malphite's Q and E, and maneuver to avoid taking damage.\n3. **Skill timing**: Look for opportunities to engage with the E→Q→W→R combo when Malphite's R is on cooldown or after he has used his skills, creating a chance for a comeback.\n4. **Item selection**: Purchasing armor penetration or life-increasing items early can be effective in countering Malphite.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the powerful engage ability of Malphite's R and the interaction with the invulnerability of Tryndamere's R. Malphite has crowd control (hard CC) in team fights, and when Tryndamere tries to all-in and gets engaged on by Malphite's R, he often loses the opportunity to counterattack. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense, making him durable against Tryndamere's auto-attacks, which can lead to unfavorable trades. Furthermore, Malphite can harass while applying a slow with his E, making it difficult for Tryndamere to manage his Fury.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early lane phase, it is crucial to freeze the wave by pulling the minions towards yourself to avoid Malphite's E+Q combo and minimize harassment. After level 6, while being cautious of Malphite's R, you can increase your damage by purchasing LDR (Lord Dominik's Regards) to ignore armor. Additionally, you can engage when your allies' CC is effective, forcing Malphite to use his R and then counterattacking to turn the fight in your favor.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite can deal high damage with his Q skill after level 6, making it easy for Kennen to have his HP reduced to half and often get killed by his ultimate. Additionally, Malphite has high tankiness, making it difficult for Kennen's attacks to land. Furthermore, Malphite's Q skill takes away Kennen's movement speed from his E skill, making it hard to escape and resulting in situations where all-ins are not possible. This leads to Kennen being pressured in lane and often falling behind in item builds.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is recommended to endure the lane with Corrupting Potion and Doran's Shield. It is important to farm while waiting for Malphite to make mistakes, maximizing the Q skill and playing defensively until you have 2-3 items. Additionally, since there are more counter picks to Malphite, caution is needed when making your selection.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Malphite's high physical defense and strong engage ability. Malphite can reduce Fiora's attack speed with his E, making her less efficient in auto-attacks, which puts her at a disadvantage in trades. Additionally, Malphite's R is a significant threat to Fiora; if she cannot parry it with her W, she may quickly find herself in a disadvantageous situation due to the knock-up. Furthermore, Fiora lacks AoE attacks, making it difficult to chip away at Malphite's durability, and she will struggle against his armor in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, Fiora should keep trades short during the laning phase, utilizing her Q for poke while conserving her W to counter Malphite's R and Q crowd control. Additionally, purchasing Black Cleaver early can help reduce Malphite's armor, increasing her damage output. Moreover, after baiting Malphite's E, using W to counter and aiming for a retaliation with R can enhance her advantage in one-on-one situations. In team fights, it is advisable to target vitals from the side and avoid Malphite's crowd control.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has strong poke ability from the early game, making it easy to create a lead with his Q. Additionally, by using his E, he can weaken Nar's reliance on auto-attacks, allowing him to gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, Malphite can use his R at level 6 to go for kills, making it difficult for Nar to counter that pressure. In mini form, Nar has low base stats and is weak to all-ins, so taking damage from Malphite puts him in a tough situation.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it's important to prioritize CS without overextending in the early game and to farm with Q. Focus on using E to clear minions while also chipping away at Malphite's armor. It's also crucial to use W to disrupt engages or follow-ups and to secure sustain. After level 6, becoming tanky and utilizing R to aim for extended fights can help alleviate Malphite's strengths. Saving Flash and timing the use of R is also important.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has strong poke abilities, and particularly his Q attacks can be harsh, making it easy for Kail to take damage from the early game. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense and is a very strong tank against AD champions, making it difficult for Kail's attacks to land. Furthermore, Malphite's ultimate knock-up effect can potentially negate Kail's invulnerability skill, creating unfavorable situations in team fights. Kail is very weak until she reaches level 6, making it hard to create advantageous situations against Malphite.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to have Doran’s Shield and Second Wind, and to heal after forcing Malphite to use his Q. Also, purchasing a refillable potion early and quickly obtaining boots to maintain distance is effective. Maximizing W should be considered to avoid Malphite's attacks while being able to deal strong damage after level 16. Ultimately, if Malphite is building AP, having him use his R on other champions will be key to victory, but ideally, it is best to avoid this matchup if possible.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite is strong in close combat, and his ultimate ability provides guaranteed damage, which is a significant threat. Teemo has a short range, and when Malphite uses his E to clear minions, it becomes difficult for Teemo to harass. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense, and by building armor, he can significantly reduce Teemo's auto-attack damage. Furthermore, Teemo's blind effect is effective against opponents who rely on auto-attacks, but Malphite uses skills to attack, which diminishes the effectiveness of the blind.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Teemo to focus on early lane harassment and aim for preemptive strikes using his Q. He can also use bushes to ambush and place mushrooms to secure vision, limiting Malphite's movements. Pushing the minions to prevent Malphite from getting close and utilizing skill advantages to avoid all-ins is also crucial. As for items, acquiring Nashor's Tooth early and stacking magic penetration can effectively increase damage against Malphite.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high armor and is a very strong tank against physical attacks. Riven primarily aims for short engagements using auto-attacks and skills, but Malphite's Q slows and E reduces attack speed, limiting Riven's attacks. Additionally, Malphite's R has high engage potential in team fights, posing a significant threat when Riven tries to go all-in. Furthermore, while Malphite is weak against AP champions, he is very durable against AD champions like Riven, making long fights unfavorable for her.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, focus on avoiding Malphite's Q while dealing damage with short combos. It is important to actively engage all-in when Malphite's R is on cooldown or when he misses it. In terms of item build, choosing items that can ignore Malphite's armor (e.g., Grievous Wounds or Blade of the Ruined King) can increase damage output. Finally, coordinating with allies' crowd control to either avoid Malphite's R or engage before he can activate it will allow Riven to leverage her strengths.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high durability, and his strength particularly stands out in late-game team fights. Pantheon excels at burst damage in the early game, but Malphite's W (shield) reduces the damage, making all-ins difficult. Additionally, Malphite's R (charge) has powerful crowd control, giving him significant influence in team fights. Pantheon’s DPS decreases in prolonged engagements, and he tends to run out of steam against tanks, leading to a continued disadvantage against Malphite.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively trade in the early game and look for opportunities when Malphite's W is on cooldown. After level 6, utilizing roams to impact other lanes and change the flow of the game can be effective. In team fights, positioning to avoid Malphite's R and being careful not to get separated is crucial. Furthermore, selecting appropriate items in the build to counter Malphite is also important.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high physical defense and is a strong tank, especially against AD champions. Jayce excels at poking in the early game, but as Malphite builds armor, that damage is mitigated, making it difficult to deal sustained damage. Additionally, Malphite's R (ultimate) knock-up effect poses a significant threat when Jayce tries to maintain distance. Furthermore, Jayce lacks sustained damage in team fights, and if Malphite takes the initiative in a team fight, Jayce becomes ineffective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early game, avoid unnecessary engagements and prioritize CS while harassing from a distance with Q (Shock Blast).\n2. If Malphite starts building armor, avoid short trades and focus on attacking while maintaining distance.\n3. After level 6, be cautious of Malphite's R (ultimate) and coordinate with teammates for team fights. By coordinating with allies' CC, create opportunities to negate Malphite's engage.\n4. In terms of items, prioritize penetration items to focus on reducing Malphite's durability.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Malphite's high physical defense and strong engage ability. Malphite can significantly reduce Yasuo's damage by stacking armor, and the knock-up from his ultimate after level 6 is particularly deadly for Yasuo. Additionally, Malphite's Q has a slow effect, which can limit Yasuo's mobility. Furthermore, by confirming Malphite's wind wall and executing a full combo (E→Q→R), it is possible to negate Yasuo's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to use minions to charge Q and poke during the early lane phase. Effectively blocking Malphite's Q with the wind wall while aiming for a quick finish by purchasing Bloodthirster items or penetration gear early can be effective. Additionally, managing waves properly and building up minions to create opportunities for a tornado (E+Q3) is crucial. At level 6, conserving the wind wall to prevent Malphite from using his R and coordinating with allies can help reduce risks.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high physical defense, which can reduce Yorick's physical damage. In particular, Malphite can perform stable wave attacks with his Q and disrupt Yorick's auto-attacks with his E, making Yorick more likely to be at a disadvantage in trades. Additionally, Malphite's knock-up effect from his R limits Yorick's actions and significantly reduces his impact in team fights. Furthermore, while Malphite is strong in prolonged battles, Yorick's weaknesses against tower sieges and split-pushing also play a role.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to push the minions early to grow the ghost and approach after forcing Malphite to use his W or R. Additionally, looking for opportunities to gank when Malphite is isolated can prevent him from utilizing his strengths. In the mid to late game, split-pushing can be effective, creating situations where Malphite cannot participate in team fights, allowing Yorick to capitalize on his strengths.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high physical defense and is a strong tank, especially against AD champions. Jax has low base health and defense in the early game and is highly reliant on items, making it difficult to counter Malphite's durability. Additionally, Malphite's E provides strong harassment and wave clear, making it hard to secure CS during the laning phase. Furthermore, Malphite's R knock-up is a significant threat in team fights for engaging, and if Jax misjudges the timing to enter, he could be taken down without being able to do anything.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, prioritizing the item \"Divine Sunderer\" is important to increase damage against Malphite. Also, using \"Grasp\" or \"Second Wind\" against early poke and focusing on short trades can provoke Malphite's E. Building health first and purchasing magic resistance early when necessary can help reduce Malphite's harassment. Finally, after acquiring 1-2 items, it becomes possible to duel and defeat Malphite, so it is crucial to farm patiently and aim for level-ups without rushing."
    },
    "loses": {
      "サイラス": "Sylas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sylas has high burst damage against Malphite, and his snowball potential becomes particularly strong when he is well-farmed. By stealing Malphite's ultimate, he can turn the engage in team fights to his advantage, allowing him to shift the tide of battle. Additionally, Sylas has multiple blinks, making it easier to dodge Malphite's attacks and trade effectively.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use W and E to poke Malphite during the early laning phase, dealing damage while healing. At level 1, wait for the minions to be low HP before using E and auto-attacks to secure all of them, and play safely after taking Malphite's Q. After surviving until level 3, align your skills to avoid Malphite's Q while attacking with E and W, dealing damage and healing at the same time. As the game progresses, Sylas will gain an advantage, so play aggressively and position yourself to become a nightmare for Malphite after level 6. If you avoid mistakes early on, you should be able to completely dominate the lane.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has ranged attacks and can safely farm CS with E while poking with Q. Malphite is a melee champion, making him more susceptible to Cho'Gath's attacks. Additionally, Cho'Gath has silence, which makes it easier to negate Malphite's skills, especially before level 6, allowing Cho'Gath to play more favorably.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to first use E to position behind minions, making it harder for Malphite to hit his R. While poking with Q, focus on avoiding Malphite's skills. After level 6, it is effective to aim for a kill with Cho'Gath's R (Feast) after Malphite uses his R. Also, securing vision and coordinating with teammates to effectively use R in team fights can lead to victory.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and multiple crowd control skills, and he possesses strong armor against Malphite's physical attacks. Since Malphite primarily relies on physical damage, Sion's durability mitigates his attacks. Additionally, Sion has a shield with his W, allowing him to absorb incoming damage, which gives him an edge in trades.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, prioritize CS without forcing trades. After Malphite uses his Q and E, you can retaliate to chip away at his resources. Save W for trades and use it after Malphite's engage to perform short trades with close-range auto-attacks. By placing E on the ground to slow him and following up with Q for chase or poke from a distance, you can maintain an advantage over Malphite.\n\nAfter level 6, it's important to use R to target the frontline in side lanes or team fights. By avoiding Malphite's R or having allies absorb it, you can increase your impact in team fights. Prioritize durability with HP and penetration in your build, focusing on magic resistance against AP Malphite and armor against AD. In team fights, create a frontline and guide your allies to engage with Malphite's initiation, allowing you to progress the battle favorably.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has high harassment ability from the early game, allowing him to deal sustained damage to Malphite using Q (Flames) and E (Harpoon). While Malphite is tanky, he often lacks damage against AP champions, making him particularly vulnerable to Rumble's sustained damage. Additionally, Rumble can manage his heat gauge to capitalize on auto-attack bursts during overheat, giving him an edge in short skirmishes.\n\nTo take advantage, Rumble should use Q and E to harass and push the wave from the start until level 3, making it easier to avoid Malphite's skills. After reaching level 3, he can use W for a shield and initiate short trades to pressure Malphite. Upon reaching level 6, it is crucial to use Rumble's R to enhance team fight control while being cautious of Malphite's R, ensuring vision and preventing his engage. This way, Rumble can maintain an advantageous position and aim for victory in team fights.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and is characterized by a playstyle that consumes HP while fighting. Malphite is a tank that is strong against physical attacks, but it is difficult to counter Dr. Mundo's healing. Additionally, Malphite's hard crowd control is only his ultimate, and he can easily negate the immobilizing effects due to Mundo's passive, making it easier to avoid Malphite's engage. Furthermore, Mundo can endure by dragging the fight into the long term, gradually healing through Malphite's damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to harass with Q in the early lane phase and avoid unnecessary trades. If Malphite deals damage that relies on auto-attacks, you can utilize your healing by dragging the fight into the long term. As for items, prioritize Spirit Visage to enhance healing, and if there is a lot of crowd control, it is advisable to choose Mercury's Treads. In team fights, you can contribute to the team by using your ultimate to heal while targeting the carries from behind.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen excels in roaming and protecting allies, and has high performance in short-term close combat. In particular, his W shield increases his durability, allowing him to counterattack even while taking hits from Malphite. Additionally, Shen is strong against divers and skirmishers that rely on auto-attacks, and he can maneuver advantageously against Malphite's physical attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it's important to initiate with Q from behind the minions and avoid prolonged fights. Between levels 3 and 5, if Malphite's Q has chipped away at your health, use W to absorb the damage and then use E to land a taunt for a quick resolution. Once you reach level 6, while being cautious of the opponent's R, you can push the lane and roam or provide shields to allies with your R, enhancing the overall strength of your team. In team fights, if Malphite engages first, it's crucial to stop him with a taunt and prioritize protecting your allies with your R. In terms of items, choosing a tank build focused on HP and armor allows you to gain an even greater advantage against Malphite.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire is strong in prolonged battles and can counter Malphite with sustained healing and damage from his Q. While Malphite has high physical defense, Bloodmire's skills deal magic damage, allowing him to break through Malphite's toughness by using items with magic penetration. Additionally, by using Bloodmire's W (Pool), he can avoid Malphite's R (Knock-Up), increasing his survival rate in team fights and critical moments.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to first use Q to farm minions while healing in the early game and to avoid unnecessary close-range fights. When Malphite approaches, chip away at him with Q→E and save W to time your R. After level 6, you can use R to enhance the damage of Q, allowing you to deal high damage to Malphite. Furthermore, in terms of item selection, choosing items like Riftmaker or Liandry's, which focus on penetration and sustained damage, will help you play favorably against Malphite. Being aware of jungle interference and the timing of your ultimate while coordinating with your team is also key to victory.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn can deal magic damage to Malphite, and particularly, Ornn's skills have crowd control, making it easier to limit Malphite's actions. Additionally, Ornn has high durability as a tank and is strong against Malphite's physical damage. Furthermore, by using Ornn's QWE combo, he can effectively deal damage to Malphite while avoiding the opponent's skills.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Ornn to play aggressively, being mindful of Malphite's W armor scaling and focusing on magic damage attacks. Taking Grasp and building Catalyst early can help mitigate poke while increasing mana. In the laning phase, it is effective to actively harass using Q and E while avoiding Malphite's skills, thereby whittling down the opponent's health.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that all of Mordekaiser's skills deal magic damage, making them effective against Malphite's physical defense. Additionally, Mordekaiser excels in long trades and can deal sustained damage, making it easier to chip away at Malphite's durability. Furthermore, with Mordekaiser's R, he can trap Malphite in the realm, creating a 1v1 situation, and if victorious, he can steal the opponent's stats.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to focus on farming during the laning phase and not to engage in fights unnecessarily. Be careful not to take poke from Malphite while using Q and W to deal damage. In terms of item selection, purchasing Riftmaker and Nashor's Tooth early is effective for increasing damage. Also, considering Malphite's E, which reduces attack speed, it is crucial to use skills at the right timing. Additionally, having the jungler come to the top lane to set up ganks can create favorable situations against Malphite.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, and his DPS is particularly strong in long fights against tanks that rely on physical attacks, like Malphite. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed and can use slows and immobilization to limit the opponent's movement, making it easier to avoid Malphite's engage. Furthermore, Singed can farm CS while dodging Malphite's Q, allowing him to create advantageous situations from the early game.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to prioritize CS with Q in the early lane and avoid Malphite's attacks. You can bait Malphite's R and Q, waiting for the right moment to counter with W → fling. After clearing minions, you can create even more advantageous situations by proxy farming when Malphite's R is down or when the enemy jungler is absent. Also, focusing on sustained AP as core items and using TP to roam can influence the entire map. In team fights, Singed aims to flank the backline and eliminate enemies with sustained poison.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, which is particularly effective against auto-attack reliant champions like Malphite. Gragas can harass from a distance using his Q (Barrel) and increase his durability while taking damage with his W. Additionally, by using his E to close the gap, he can avoid Malphite's approach and trade favorably. Furthermore, after level 6, he can use his R to disrupt Malphite's engage and play a role in dividing the enemy during team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it is important to harass from a distance with Q and gain a shield with W to win short trades. When Malphite approaches, use E to create distance and trade with the Q→AA→W combo. Once you reach level 6, save your R and prepare to counter Malphite's roams or engages. In the mid to late game, use R in side lanes or team fights to split the enemy and safely retreat with E, maximizing Gragas's strengths.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in lane. In particular, Malphite's Q skill can block Gangplank's Q, making it difficult for Malphite to deal damage to Gangplank. Additionally, Malphite tends to all-in after level 3, allowing Gangplank to harass beforehand and chip away at Malphite's health. Furthermore, by using Gangplank's W skill, he can remove Malphite's slow while healing, allowing him to fight while maintaining durability.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to harass between levels 1 and 2 to reduce Malphite's health. After level 3, you should avoid trading with Malphite, but by always keeping your W skill ready to remove slows, you can play safely. Additionally, placing barrels above yourself and using minion aggro to trade effectively is beneficial. Manage vision carefully and pay attention to Malphite's ultimate and jungle ganks while aiming to reach three items on Gangplank. This will help maintain an advantageous situation without being disrupted in the mid-game.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control, and his skill set is particularly effective in matchups between tanks. Malphite is primarily a tank that is strong against physical attacks, but K'Sante's damage and mobility increase in all-out situations, giving him high 1v1 performance. Additionally, K'Sante has a shield, making it easier to maintain durability when taking hits from Malphite.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to prioritize farming in the lane and to engage when Malphite's W is on cooldown. By absorbing Malphite's engage with tank form and W's damage reduction, and utilizing K'Sante's passive to ensure consistent damage with Q, W, E, and R auto-attacks, you can deal damage while maintaining durability. Furthermore, securing magic resistance and prioritizing items like Jak'Sho can allow you to play even more favorably against Malphite.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has powerful percentage damage against tanks, which is particularly effective against champions like Malphite that rely on physical defense. Additionally, by using Gwen's W, she can avoid the damage from Malphite's Q, increasing her survivability in team fights. Furthermore, being in the mist makes it easier for Gwen to evade enemy attacks and also allows her to avoid Malphite's hard CC, his R.\n\nTo take advantage, first, purchase Doran's Shield in the early fight to counter Malphite's initial damage from his W. After level 6, Malphite's R becomes powerful, so it's important to use W to mitigate that damage while employing a farming strategy to gather large minion waves under the tower, wasting Malphite's resources. In terms of item build, rushing CDR and prioritizing Rocketbelt can improve positioning and increase impact in team fights. Using Flash to dodge Malphite's R is also a crucial point to gain an advantage in the match.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and all of his skills come with dashes, making it easier to avoid Malphite's attacks. In particular, by utilizing short dashes to dodge Malphite's Q and auto-attacks, he can trade without taking damage. Additionally, since Malphite primarily relies on physical attacks, he can create situations where he struggles against Anbessa's sustained damage output.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be cautious in the early game to avoid being attacked by Malphite first, while using Q and E to clear minions and poke him for damage. Make sure to build up your passive and focus on dodging Malphite's attacks with short dashes. In the mid-game, using W to gain a shield while either tanking Malphite's R or dodging it with a dash just before it hits is crucial. In the late game, prioritize positioning to avoid being disrupted by Malphite's R, and instead of forcing a fight with Malphite, it is more effective to focus on attacking the backline."

      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Dr. Mundo's high healing ability. Mundo has an extremely high self-healing capacity, and in prolonged fights, his healing can surpass Malphite's damage, making him prone to unfavorable trades. Additionally, Mundo's passive allows him to negate hard crowd control, making Malphite's R engage less effective. Furthermore, Mundo fights by consuming his HP, so even if Malphite deals burst damage, Mundo can withstand it with his subsequent healing.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to harass from a distance with Q early on and not to force trades. Before reaching level 6, check Mundo's ultimate usage, and when he doesn't have it, you can aim for a short-term engagement with your R. Buying a Bramble Vest early can also be effective in reducing Mundo's healing. In team fights, using your R proactively and applying area CC to stick to the carry is necessary to prevent Mundo from utilizing his healing effectively.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and exhibits strong durability, especially against AP tanks. Gangplank has low base stats in the early game and is heavily reliant on items and levels, making it difficult to counter Mundo's healing. Additionally, avoiding Mundo's Q skill is crucial, but making a mistake can lead to the risk of being caught. Furthermore, Mundo has a passive that negates hard CC, making Gangplank's harassment and kiting less effective.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to stand behind minions and use barrels for harassment. You can disrupt farming with your Q skill and purchase Executioner's Calling to reduce Mundo's healing by half. Additionally, avoiding close combat and adopting a kiting strategy with barrels can be effective. Trying Stormraider's Surge can delay Mundo's CC, making kiting easier. In terms of item build, it is recommended to choose Ninja Tabi, Boots of Swiftness, and Executioner's Calling. This will help you progress the matchup against Mundo in your favor.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo is a very strong counter to Kennen. Mundo has a high HP ratio and self-healing ability, allowing him to recover from Kennen's damage while fighting. Although Kennen can farm and harass using his range, when he takes damage from Mundo's \"Cleaver,\" Mundo can heal that damage with \"Doran's Shield\" and \"Second Wind.\" Furthermore, once he reaches level 6, Mundo can dive under towers, making it difficult for Kennen to respond to that pressure. Additionally, Mundo's passive negates Kennen's stun, preventing him from fighting effectively. In team fights, Mundo attacking the backline can buy time for Kennen to use his ultimate.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to be cautious with harassment in lane and to avoid Mundo's skills. Specifically, positioning should be adjusted to avoid Mundo's \"Cleaver.\" In terms of item build, purchasing items with Grievous Wounds (e.g., Graves' \"Graves' Blade\") early can effectively reduce Mundo's healing. Furthermore, coordinating with teammates to engage in team fights and isolating Mundo is crucial to create opportunities for Kennen's stun and ultimate.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high healing power from the early game, and his style of fighting while consuming HP is particularly strong. After using Mundo's Q (Cleave), Jax needs to time his attacks carefully, but due to Mundo's high healing, it is difficult to gain an advantage in sustained trades. Additionally, Mundo has a passive that negates hard CC, making it easier for him to shrug off Jax's attacks, especially in the early game when Jax finds it hard to deal damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Mundo's Q first. After he uses Q, it is recommended to approach with Jax's E (Leap), attack, and then retreat immediately. Furthermore, after level 6, Mundo's healing increases, so looking for opportunities to attack when he is below 500 HP can be effective. Additionally, building Trinity Force or Sundrider and pushing waves to contribute to the team is also important. In team fights, it is advisable to leverage Jax's strengths and join at the right timing.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability, especially becoming strong in prolonged fights when using his ultimate. Darius is powerful in the early game, but engaging in fights while Mundo's ultimate is active carries a high risk of taking damage. Additionally, Mundo can negate hard crowd control with his passive, making it easier to avoid Darius's skills and difficult to deal sustained damage. Furthermore, Mundo has the characteristics of an AP tank, providing high durability against Darius's physical damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to actively deal damage and stack bleed between levels 1 and 3 to gain an early advantage. Next, it is effective to attack when Mundo's ultimate is on cooldown. Additionally, purchasing healing reduction items (like Bramble Vest or Executioner's Calling) early can help suppress Mundo's healing. Finally, securing vision and being cautious of jungle interference while aiming for short skirmishes is crucial.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a very high self-healing ability, allowing him to offset Sion's damage by dragging the fight into a long-term battle. Additionally, Mundo can negate hard crowd control with his passive, making it easier for him to avoid Sion's CC from Q and E, which makes it difficult for Sion to play advantageously. Furthermore, Mundo fights by consuming his HP, so even if Sion deals damage in the short term, Mundo can recover afterward, making Sion's attacks less effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase items like Grievous Wounds (Executioner's Calling) and Bramble Vest → Thornmail early to disrupt Mundo's healing. In the early game, you should aim for a short knock-up with E and deal damage with Q while trying to avoid long-term fights. In the mid to late game, using R to apply side pressure and coordinating with teammates to secure kills can increase your chances of countering Mundo.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Dr. Mundo's high healing and durability. Mundo fights by consuming HP and has a very high self-healing ability, making Cho'Gath disadvantaged in prolonged battles. Additionally, Mundo's passive allows him to negate hard CC, making it difficult for Cho'Gath to restrict Mundo's actions even when using his W (Silence). Furthermore, Cho'Gath has a slow skill activation, making it hard to retaliate when taking damage from Mundo.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance in the early game while using E (Rupture) and Q (Feral Scream) to initiate attacks. Using Ignite to suppress Mundo's healing and quickly disengaging after dealing damage in short trades is also necessary. In the mid to late game, building MR items to reduce Mundo's damage and maintaining presence in team fights is crucial. Save R (Feast) for guaranteed kills and avoid unnecessary chasing. Strengthening coordination with teammates and aiming for assured kills is key to alleviating the disadvantage.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high self-healing capabilities and can deal significant damage even with a tank build, making it difficult for Teemo to break him down with his short burst damage. Additionally, Mundo can negate hard crowd control with his passive, making Teemo's blind effect less effective and leaving him vulnerable to Mundo's attacks. Furthermore, Mundo fights by consuming his HP, which means Teemo needs to avoid prolonged engagements, making it hard to recover if he falls behind early.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to place a ward and mushrooms in the bushes at the start to hinder Mundo's approach. During the laning phase, try to block Mundo's auto-attacks with your Q and aim to win short trades. Buying Grievous Wounds early (e.g., with Morellonomicon) is effective in shutting down Mundo's healing. In trades, use your E and auto-attacks to poke him down quickly and retreat before his healing activates. Avoid all-ins and only chase when you are sure you can secure a kill, waiting for your teammates' crowd control or jungle intervention. In team fights, it is effective to slow down Mundo with poison and mushrooms from a distance while poking and providing vision control from the side.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a very high self-healing ability and fights in a style that consumes HP. Due to Mundo's passive, he can often negate hard CC, making it easier for him to avoid Renekton's stun effect and lose the advantage in trades. Additionally, Mundo has high durability as an AP tank, allowing him to absorb Renekton's damage more easily. Furthermore, once Mundo gets his items, it becomes harder for Renekton to deal damage, especially in the early game, where Mundo can play more favorably.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Renekton to create advantageous situations early on. Specifically, it is effective to actively trade before Mundo acquires Warmog's and to use Ignite early to suppress Mundo's healing. Choosing Swift Shoes can help avoid Mundo's Q, allowing for more favorable trades. Additionally, building items like Void Staff or Ravenous Hydra can make it easier to counter Mundo's healing. In team fights, it is advisable to focus on one-on-one combat with Mundo and trade when he is losing HP.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high healing capabilities and is strong in prolonged fights. Jayce can gain an advantage with early burst damage, but Mundo can offset that damage with his healing and can sustain in fights. Additionally, Mundo's sustain increases after level 6, making it harder for Jayce's burst to be effective. Furthermore, Mundo's passive allows him to negate hard crowd control, making it easier for him to dodge Jayce's skills and potentially losing the advantage in close combat.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to be aware of Mundo's healing and harass him with Q→W to chip away at his health. It is also effective to avoid forcing a prolonged 1v1 and instead use roaming and vision to impact other lanes. In terms of item build, securing mana early on is crucial to enable sustained harassment. Additionally, being mindful of positioning to avoid Mundo's skills and fighting while maintaining distance with EQ→W can help reduce the damage taken from his attacks.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and very high durability as a tank, allowing him to quickly recover from Quinn's burst damage. Additionally, Mundo has a passive that negates immobilizing effects, making it difficult for Quinn to effectively utilize her CC skills, and when he gets close, she is at a disadvantage in a brawl. Furthermore, Mundo has strong lane sustain from the early game, which means he can apply pressure before Quinn can scale.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Apply early pressure**: It is important for Quinn to actively harass from the early game and chip away at Mundo's HP. Specifically, using her Q to attack from a distance and timing her W to escape is advisable.\n\n2. **Minion management**: Properly managing minions to create a situation where Mundo has difficulty farming is crucial. Being mindful of wave clearing and timing ganks when Mundo comes to lane can also be effective.\n\n3. **Utilize roaming**: By leveraging Quinn's high mobility to roam to other lanes and aim for kills, she can impact the game as a whole. Particularly, moving to other lanes after clearing minions can reduce pressure on Mundo.\n\n4. **Item build adjustments**: Consider purchasing Blade of the Ruined King (BORK) early to increase damage and strengthen her ability to deal damage to Mundo.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Quinn can alleviate her disadvantage against Dr. Mundo and progress the game in her favor.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Dr. Mundo's high natural regeneration and durability. Mundo fights by consuming HP, and especially after level 6, he can recover significantly with his ultimate, making it difficult for Camille in prolonged fights. Even if Camille attempts a short burst (E→Q2→R), Mundo's regeneration mitigates the damage, making it hard to deal sustained damage. Furthermore, while Mundo is weak to crowd control, Camille's attacks aim for a quick finish, so if Mundo can absorb those attacks, the risk of counterattacks increases.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial for Camille to aim for a quick finish at the start. Specifically, purchasing items like Bramble Vest or Executioner's Calling early and focusing on the timing of E wall hits and Q2 attacks can be effective. Additionally, after level 6, using her ultimate to isolate Mundo and combining it with Ignite can deal instant damage. Moreover, considering items with Grievous Wounds in her itemization can also be effective in reducing Mundo's healing.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Dr. Mundo's high healing and durability. Mundo has a fighting style that consumes HP while battling, and his self-healing ability is extremely high, allowing him to almost negate Urgot's damage. Additionally, Mundo's passive allows him to negate hard CC, making Urgot's crowd control less effective. Furthermore, Urgot is highly dependent on levels in the early game, and if he is not at the same level, it is difficult to gain an advantage over Mundo.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important for Urgot to stand behind minions to block Mundo's Q and reduce damage. Also, using E-Flash-Ignite at level 2 can allow Urgot to aim for a kill before Mundo has items. Regarding item builds, choosing Blade of the Ruined King (BORK) or Goredrinker can increase damage against Mundo. Moreover, gaining a lead in CS (creep score) is key to victory, so it is crucial to farm effectively.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a very high self-healing ability and can deal significant damage even with a tank build, giving him excellent durability in lane. Especially when Mundo uses his R (Ultimate Healing), Gragas finds it difficult to deal damage in prolonged fights. Additionally, Mundo has a passive that negates immobilizing effects, allowing him to effectively avoid Gragas's crowd control (stuns and knockbacks), making it hard for Gragas to create advantageous situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Bring Ignite or Grievous Wounds items to suppress Mundo's healing.\n2. Purchase AP items (like the Soulstealer) early to enhance harassment and reduce Mundo's health quickly.\n3. Repeatedly harass with Q to force Mundo to use his healing early, allowing for favorable trades.\n4. Once you see that Mundo has used his R, avoid prolonged fights and focus on short trades.\n5. Push the lane and roam to increase influence in other lanes, avoiding one-on-one situations with Mundo.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, it is possible to alleviate Gragas's disadvantage and create more favorable situations.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo is strong in prolonged fights and has high self-healing capabilities. Especially after level 6, Mundo can recover significantly with his R, making Pantheon's short burst less effective. Additionally, Mundo fights by consuming HP, so even when he takes Pantheon's stuns and burst damage, he often can withstand it due to his healing. Furthermore, Mundo has a passive that negates hard CC, making Pantheon's W stun less effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase Executioner’s Calling (or Bramble) early to reduce Mundo's healing. In the early lane phase, you should poke with Q while ensuring that you land W's stun to aim for a burst. After level 6, be aware of Mundo's R and consider bursting him before he uses it or using Ignite during his R to suppress his healing. Additionally, utilizing roams to impact other lanes should also be considered to create an overall advantage.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high durability from the early game and possesses a very strong self-healing ability, making it easy for him to shrug off Kail's attacks. Particularly, Kail is in a very tough situation as a melee champion until she reaches level 6, making it difficult to counter Mundo's tankiness. Additionally, Mundo can negate hard crowd control with his passive, which limits the effectiveness of Kail's slow-ability skills. Furthermore, as Mundo levels up, he becomes increasingly powerful, often gaining the upper hand before Kail can scale.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to play carefully during the laning phase, focusing on farming while avoiding Mundo's attacks. Specifically, using E to poke and timing the avoidance of Mundo's skills is essential. After reaching level 6, it is important to utilize R to negate Mundo's attacks while creating opportunities to deal damage. In terms of item build, if there is a carry with %HP damage, prioritizing AP items and increasing DPS can be effective in countering Mundo. Ultimately, enduring the laning phase is vital to enhance influence in team fights."

    "loses": {
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control (CC) and can deal damage in short trades while avoiding Dr. Mundo's Q with his E. Additionally, K'Sante can become tanky with his R and increase his damage output, which can nullify Mundo's healing. Furthermore, by preparing Grievous Wounds, K'Sante can suppress Mundo's sustained healing, making it difficult to engage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important for K'Sante to use his Q from behind the minions and attack with auto-attacks while dodging Mundo's Q with his E. After level 6, using his R to become tanky and combining it with Ignite to suppress Mundo's healing while aiming for kills is effective. Additionally, choosing items like Black Cleaver and Executioner's Calling to maintain Grievous Wounds can help K'Sante gain an upper hand against Mundo.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has percentage damage and true damage, which allows her to effectively deal damage against Dr. Mundo's high HP ratio. Additionally, by using Gwen's W, she can dodge Mundo's Q, reducing his damage while gaining an advantage in trades. Furthermore, since Mundo lacks crowd control, Gwen can move freely and attack, especially gaining an edge in early trades.\n\nTo take advantage, actively engage in early trades in the lane, utilizing Gwen's auto-attacks to deal damage. It's important to focus on dodging Mundo's Q with W, making him waste his skills to gain an advantage in trades. Also, by acquiring the Oblivion Orb early, Gwen can suppress Mundo's healing, creating an even more favorable situation. While waiting for items to come together, it's crucial to avoid Mundo's attacks, secure CS, and aim for level-ups.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox deals high damage to Dr. Mundo, especially being able to surpass his healing capabilities. Aatrox's skills excel in continuous attacks, particularly using his Q skill to deal sustained damage to Dr. Mundo. Additionally, Aatrox can use his W, which has a knock-up, to limit Mundo's movements and increase opportunities for attacks. Furthermore, Aatrox's passive healing effect also surpasses Dr. Mundo's healing, allowing him to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first actively trade in the lane, using Q to deal damage to Dr. Mundo while aiming for healing. Especially, after Mundo uses his skills, targeting the openings with W for a knock-up makes it easier to deal damage. It is also important to use E to maintain distance while attacking and avoid Mundo's skills. After level 6, using R further increases durability, allowing for favorable engagements against Dr. Mundo. Proper timing of skill usage and positioning is the key to victory.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has high burst damage in the early game and possesses means to suppress Dr. Mundo's healing. Riven's skills allow her to deal damage with short combos, and particularly the Q→AA→Q sequence is effective in dealing damage to Mundo. Additionally, Riven has high mobility, making it easier to dodge Mundo's skills, which allows her to gain an advantage in trades.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use short combos to poke and chip away at Mundo's HP between levels 1 and 3. Especially with Ignite, Riven can suppress Mundo's healing and aim for an early kill. Furthermore, purchasing Executioner's Calling or Bramble Vest early can weaken Mundo's strengths by reducing his healing. In trades, focusing on short engagements and attacking with full force before Mundo's R activates for healing is key.\n\nIn wave management, when ahead, pushing minions in front of the enemy tower and roaming can influence other lanes. Conversely, when behind, freezing the minion wave and waiting for jungle intervention can reduce risk. It is crucial to secure a decisive advantage before entering the late game, as Mundo becoming a full tank can lead to a disadvantage.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high sustain and damage against Dr. Mundo, making it easier to gain an upper hand, especially in the laning phase. Mundo is weak in the early game and is vulnerable to Irelia's harassment and all-ins. Additionally, Irelia's E can help prevent Mundo's healing, which is crucial for stopping his passive recovery. Furthermore, Irelia has a blink ability, allowing her to easily dodge Mundo's attacks and initiate her own.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to harass from level 1 to 2 and prevent Mundo from contesting at level 3. If you have a lead at level 6, you can go for an all-in, and maintaining tempo will be key to victory. Bringing Corrupting Potion and Time Warp Tonic is effective for sustaining in lane while hindering Mundo's healing. Requesting a gank to take down Mundo and securing items can create an even more advantageous situation.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick excels in short trades, especially after level 6, where his R (Suppression) provides high crowd control, allowing him to temporarily negate Dr. Mundo's healing while dealing instant damage. Additionally, Warwick's healing increases as his HP decreases, giving him an edge in trades against Dr. Mundo. Furthermore, while Dr. Mundo is strong in extended fights, Warwick can exploit this trait by initiating short skirmishes, potentially deciding the match before Mundo can build items.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game (1-5), use Q for mini-trades and W to heal while keeping the opponent at bay. It's important to push the lane to avoid long trades with Mundo at full health and to lure enemy jungle intervention. Once you reach level 6, use R to lock down Mundo and deal burst damage with Q and auto-attacks. During this time, coordinating with allies' Graves' wounds or Ignite to reduce Mundo's healing is effective.\n\nIn the mid-game (6-15), as Mundo builds items, extended fights become unfavorable, so aim for short picks in side lanes or around objectives, coordinating with teleport and jungle for attacks. In the late game, it's crucial to prevent Mundo from dragging out fights, and in team fights, it's important to eliminate his sources of healing first. Specifically, using marks, Graves' wounds, and crowd control to suppress Mundo's healing, while coordinating with multiple teammates, is an effective strategy.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage. Dr. Mundo has high durability and tankiness, but Yasuo can leverage his mobility and knock-up to fight effectively. In particular, Yasuo can attack over minions with his Q, avoiding prolonged fights and suppressing Mundo's healing. Additionally, by using Yasuo's W to block projectiles and reduce damage taken, it becomes easier to withstand Mundo's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, start by using Q to clear minions while dealing damage to Mundo in the early stages of the lane. Use E to reposition and aim for a tornado, creating a favorable situation against Mundo. After level 6, avoid committing to an all-in while Mundo's ultimate is active, and use R to deal burst damage when you land a knock-up. It's also important to purchase grievous wounds items early to suppress Mundo's healing. Secure vision, utilize jungle interference to create advantages, and in team fights, it is effective to disable Mundo with crowd control before attacking.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick can leverage early pressure to aim for a quick finish, making it easier to gain an upper hand against Dr. Mundo. Yorick's Knight (the ghost) can suppress Mundo's healing, and it's particularly important to deal damage before Mundo can heal. Additionally, Yorick can easily manipulate minions, securing them with his E while dealing chip damage to Mundo.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first stabilize the minion wave at the start and manage the minions with W. Next, between levels 2 and 6, use E to secure minions while dealing damage to Mundo. The moment after Mundo's Q heals is the perfect opportunity to engage, using the Knight as the starting point for the fight. Furthermore, it's crucial to prepare healing reduction items (like Executioner's Calling or Bramble Vest) early on to suppress Mundo's sustain. During an all-in, aim for a quick finish using Knight + E + Q, and when Mundo starts to heal, don't overcommit and push towards the tower. In team fights, focus on splitting off to the side and using the Knight to take down Mundo, prioritizing healing disruption over prolonged engagements.",
      "トランドル": "Trundle has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle can gain an upper hand in short trades against Dr. Mundo. With Trundle's Q, he can execute auto-attack healing trades, dealing damage before Mundo can recover. Additionally, Trundle's R allows him to steal Mundo's HP and MR, reducing his durability and creating an even more favorable situation. While Mundo is strong in prolonged fights, Trundle excels at dealing damage in short trades while chipping away at the opponent's durability.\n\nTo take advantage, Trundle should start by using Q to repeatedly engage in auto-attack trades in the early game, whittling down Mundo's health. He can earn defensive stats with W while using E to block Mundo's escape routes. During mini all-ins, he should use E to restrict Mundo's movement, then attack after using R to steal durability. After Mundo uses his R, his healing increases, so timing the attack becomes crucial. If there is jungle intervention, Trundle can further solidify his advantage.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high critical damage and HP recovery abilities, and especially with his ultimate, he becomes immortal for 5 seconds, making it easier to negate Dr. Mundo's healing capabilities. While Mundo is strong in prolonged fights, Tremendous can leverage his strength in short skirmishes, making it easier to aim for kills by attacking while checking Mundo's ultimate and healing items. Additionally, by managing Fury, Tremendous can trade favorably and chip away at Mundo's HP.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, focus on building Fury from minions while being careful not to push the lane too much. Once you reach level 6, check Mundo's ultimate and healing methods, and attack with full force when the opponent is vulnerable. Also, by building healing reduction items (like Executioner or Mortal Reminder) early, you can suppress Mundo's healing and deal sustained damage. In team fights, it is important to deal with Mundo individually before joining the rest of the team to contribute to the overall battle.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and all of his skills come with dashes, allowing him to actively engage Doctor Mundo. In particular, Doctor Mundo lacks crowd control in the early game, making it easy to deal damage by landing Anbessa's Q while also being able to escape. Additionally, Anbessa has significant short-term damage output, which can surpass Mundo's healing, giving him an edge in lane trades.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use the initial Q to gain priority. By using Ignite while Mundo's W is on cooldown, you can aim for a burst and establish lane control by dealing early damage. You can also leverage level-ups to overwhelm Mundo and gain a CS lead, allowing you to complete Eclipse quickly. Furthermore, by choosing Mortal Reminder, you can suppress Mundo's healing and gain an advantage in fights.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has short-term burst damage and means to negate Dr. Mundo's healing. In particular, Yone's skills focus on critical hits, allowing him to deal high damage instantly. While Mundo is strong in prolonged fights, if Yone can deal damage early and suppress Mundo's healing, he can gain the upper hand. Additionally, by aiming for a full combo the moment Mundo uses his W, it is possible to chip away at Mundo's durability.\n\nTo take advantage, first manage the minions in the early lane while chipping away at Mundo with Q. Use sidesteps or E to dodge Mundo's Q, and after level 3, deal damage with short combos (Q→AA→E) while disengaging. When Mundo uses his W, aim for a full combo and save Ignite to suppress his healing while looking for a kill. Also, choosing items like Black Cleaver, penetration items, and Grievous Wounds is important to increase damage against Mundo and consider countering his lifesteal. It’s also good to coordinate with the jungle to eliminate kill opportunities for Mundo.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi can deploy her tentacles by landing her E, allowing her to deal high burst damage. Dr. Mundo has strong sustained healing, but Illaoi's burst damage in short skirmishes often surpasses Mundo's healing. Additionally, Illaoi can use her tentacles to deal continuous damage, especially by engaging when Mundo misses his Q, giving her an advantageous position.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize CS in the early game, and when Mundo misses his Q, land your E to deploy tentacles and deal damage with auto-attacks (AA) or Q. If you have Ignite, it becomes easier to secure kills. Also, purchasing Bramble Vest or early health/armor items makes it easier to counter Mundo's healing. In the mid-game and beyond, focus on fighting in areas with tentacles, and while split-pushing, aim for 1v1s against Mundo to create even more advantageous situations.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high burst damage against Dr. Mundo, allowing her to gain an upper hand, especially in one-on-one fights. By using Fiora's W (Riposte), she can negate Mundo's Q (Cleave) and other attacks, enabling her to counterattack. Additionally, Fiora can choose items with Grievous Wounds to counter Mundo's sustained healing, effectively reducing his sustain.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important for Fiora to target Mundo's vitals with her Q, dealing damage while reducing his sustain. After Mundo uses his E or W, Fiora can maximize damage by executing Q → AA → R to hit the vital. Furthermore, by actively engaging before Mundo's R activates, she can suppress his healing potential. Additionally, preparing Ignite or items with Grievous Wounds as a counter to healing can nullify Mundo's recovery and help Fiora gain an advantage in fights.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn can deal high damage to Dr. Mundo in the early laning phase, especially when Mundo comes to farm CS, allowing Ornn to significantly reduce his HP with combos. Additionally, Ornn has crowd control skills, which can limit Mundo's movements, making it easier to gain lane dominance. Furthermore, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at maintaining the lane and providing high sustainability.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Ornn to avoid Mundo's Q (Cleave). By hiding behind minions and fighting, Ornn can dodge Mundo's attacks while increasing the chances to land his skills. Buying \"Hollow Radiance\" as the first item can speed up wave clear, putting pressure on Mundo. Additionally, purchasing \"Bramble Vest\" early can suppress Mundo's healing, and choosing \"Second Wind\" or \"Doran's Shield\" can enhance sustainability.\n\nIn the late game, as Mundo becomes stronger, team coordination becomes crucial. It is especially important to seek ganks from the jungler, and if Mundo is strong in the side lane, focusing on wave clear in the mid lane or other lanes is essential. In team fights, it is advantageous to avoid trying to kill Mundo recklessly and to consider the overall strategy while fighting.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has a high damage true damage R ability against Dr. Mundo, allowing him to deal damage while ignoring Mundo's high healing capabilities. Additionally, Garen's Q ability provides a silence effect that can prevent Mundo from using his skills, giving Garen an edge, especially in one-on-one fights. Furthermore, Garen has strong lane sustain and can continuously fight thanks to his passive healing effect.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to reach level 2 first and secure an early offensive advantage. Standing behind minions and avoiding Mundo's Q ability \"Cleave\" while trading shortly after he uses his skills is advisable. Also, avoid trading with a full HP Mundo near the tower, and aim for an all-in after forcing Mundo to use his ultimate. It is crucial not to chase recklessly, to attack at the right timing, and to consider resets.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen excels at engaging in short skirmishes against Dr. Mundo and can use his E's taunt to limit Mundo's actions. While Mundo has high self-healing capabilities, Shen can mitigate that healing by applying Grievous Wounds early on. Additionally, Shen's global support ability with his R is particularly effective when Mundo is isolated.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, avoid Mundo's Q in the early lane phase while repeatedly poking him for damage. Once you reach level 6, use your R to intervene in other lanes and support your teammates to create an overall advantage. During an all-in timing, it is crucial to land the taunt with E and then unleash burst damage while suppressing Mundo's healing. As for items, purchasing Bramble Vest early is effective in reducing Mundo's healing.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus can demonstrate overwhelming strength in the late game by stacking his Q, making him very powerful in the late game. Additionally, by using his W, Wither, he can suppress Dr. Mundo's pursuit and create situations where he cannot utilize his self-healing abilities. Furthermore, Nasus can deal high damage even with a tank build, making it easier for him to survive in team fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, prioritize farming minions to stack Q in the early game, and maintain a freeze while pushing the tower. If Dr. Mundo approaches, you can stop him with W and retaliate with E to mitigate his harassment. Also, after level 6, it is important to secure Q while using Nasus's W and transition to side lanes or tower fights without overextending. Purchasing MR items early can reduce Dr. Mundo's damage, allowing you to maintain your lane more safely.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained poison damage and can equip items with Grievous Wounds to counter Dr. Mundo's high healing. Additionally, Singed has high mobility and is skilled at using slows and immobilizations to limit Mundo's movement while engaging in short trades. Mundo is weak in the early game, allowing Singed to take advantage by being aggressive.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, constantly push the lane while being mindful of the enemy jungle and aim for proxy farming. In trades, pull the opponent in with a quick Q (Fling), then use W (Poison) to deal sustained damage while quickly disengaging. After level 6, look for opportunities to attack when Mundo's R (healing) is down, and enhance your own R in fights. In team fights, it’s important not to engage Mundo alone; instead, chip away at him with poison while using Fling to send enemies towards your allies or focus on disruption. Always be aware of Grievous Wounds and aim for short skirmishes or splits to maximize Singed's strengths."

      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton is strong in early short trades and excels at all-ins. Renekton can utilize Fury to unleash powerful combos and use his low cooldown skills to trade favorably. On the other hand, Yorick relies on his pets, and his combat ability decreases when they are not present. Additionally, Renekton's skills with stun effects make it easy for Yorick to become immobilized, especially between levels 1 and 5 when he is more susceptible to Renekton's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid taking unnecessary damage from Renekton and prioritize CS while healing with minions. Using Q to secure CS while utilizing E for delays and slows to maintain distance from Renekton is essential to avoid risky trades. Furthermore, after level 6, leveraging Maiden to engage in prolonged fights can increase Yorick's chances against Renekton. It is also crucial to use Flash and Ignite appropriately to avoid Renekton's all-ins.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton can interrupt Riven's combos with his W, which has a stun, making it likely for Riven to be countered before she can deal damage, especially in short trades. Additionally, Renekton can sustain fights while healing with Fury, putting Riven at a disadvantage in longer engagements. Furthermore, Renekton's increased durability from his R is also troublesome for Riven. Riven has many mobility skills, and if she gets caught by Renekton's CC, she becomes unable to do anything, making it difficult to approach.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to engage in short trades after baiting Renekton's W. After level 3, approach with E, deal damage with Q and AA, and either avoid the stun with W or disengage immediately after getting hit. Proper wave management is also crucial; by not pushing too deep, you can avoid Renekton's ganks. As for items, opting for early health and boots, while focusing on burst damage, allows Riven to leverage her strengths while countering Renekton's sustained damage.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton is strong in short trades and excels in trading and sustain. Renekton's W (stun) CC effect limits Yasuo's movement, making it difficult for Yasuo to retaliate, especially when trades are initiated between levels 2 and 6. Additionally, Renekton's ultimate (Dominus) increases his durability, making it harder for Yasuo to deal damage. Furthermore, Yasuo has low base stats and is vulnerable to CC and ganks, so taking hits from Renekton can quickly weaken him.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm behind minions using Q in the early game and to use E through minions to avoid direct engagement. Timing a short auto-attack followed by Q to retaliate after Renekton uses W is crucial, and avoiding long trades is necessary. After level 6, utilizing W (Wind Wall) to block Renekton's attacks and coordinating with allies for a knock-up to aim for R can create opportunities for a comeback. By preparing items and focusing on trading at the right moments, it is possible to alleviate the disadvantage.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton has strong short-term burst damage in the early game and high lane control. Renekton actively trades at levels 2 and 3, so Irelia needs to focus on securing CS by hitting minions with her Q instead of forcing attacks. Additionally, Renekton's W knock-up restricts Irelia's actions and creates unfavorable situations when trying to go for short-term all-ins. Furthermore, Irelia struggles with early wave pushing and finds it difficult to counter Renekton's sustain abilities.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forcing attacks in the early lane and manage the wave by hitting minions with Q. To avoid Renekton's trades, using W to reduce damage and timing counterattacks is necessary. After level 6, Irelia can utilize her R to pursue or divide enemies, creating opportunities to gain an advantage through short-term all-ins. Additionally, being aware of bushes and being cautious of enemy jungle interventions is crucial to minimize the chances of taking damage from Renekton.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton is strong in early short trades, especially at levels 2-3 and level 6. Renekton can unleash powerful combos using Fury and has high sustain, making it easy for Yone to find himself in unfavorable situations when trying to trade. Additionally, Renekton's W stun effect limits Yone's movement and takes away his chances to counterattack. Furthermore, Yone is highly item-dependent, making lane combat difficult until he gets his items.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to engage in long trades early on and to poke with Q while maintaining distance with E. By counterattacking shortly after Renekton uses Fury, Yone can create opportunities to deal damage. After level 6, using R to escape or chase, and rotating to the side for roaming or split-pushing can be effective. Managing waves, freezing the lane to stretch the enemy, and inviting jungle ganks are also useful strategies.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the powerful trading ability and CC skills that Renekton possesses. Renekton is very strong before level 3, especially with combos utilizing Fury, allowing him to deal high damage. Additionally, Renekton's W can break shields, making Sett's W less effective, which makes it difficult for Sett to deal sustained damage. Furthermore, Renekton can leverage his strength in close combat to hinder Sett's approach, making it hard for Sett to initiate trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to aim for an ambush at level 1 to gain early damage and establish control. Additionally, attacking after forcing Renekton to use his skills can reduce his damage output. Predicting Renekton's dash with E and timing your Q to attack can also be effective. Furthermore, using minions to freeze the wave and lure Renekton in is a viable strategy. This way, Sett can engage in trades more favorably against Renekton.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Renekton's high sustain ability and strong trading potential. Renekton can enhance his skills using Fury, dealing significant damage especially with combos involving Q and empowered W. Additionally, when Renekton's Fury is high, he can initiate very powerful trades, making it difficult for Anbessa to avoid his attacks. Furthermore, Renekton has a strong power spike after level 2, which often makes early trades unfavorable.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to initiate trades when Renekton's Fury is below 30 or when his W is on cooldown. Also, playing aggressively at level 1 to gain a small lead before Renekton reaches level 2 is crucial. Rune and item choices are also important; purchasing Ninja Tabi early can effectively reduce Renekton's damage. Additionally, controlling the lane and utilizing minions and levels to create advantageous situations is key to avoiding contact with Renekton."
    },
    "loses": {
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn possesses high mobility and burst damage, and she demonstrates strong denial against melee champions. Renekton is a champion specialized in close combat, but Quinn can attack safely by utilizing her range. Additionally, with combos that leverage Quinn's passive, it becomes easier to negate Renekton's sustain, allowing for a potential snowball in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to maintain distance to avoid Renekton's initial E. By forcing Renekton to use E on minions, you can negate his second dash. Also, ensure that Quinn's auto-attack range is greater than Renekton's E range, and position yourself correctly to dodge his attacks. Furthermore, it is dangerous to return with E after Renekton uses his W, so timing your attacks effectively can be beneficial. This way, you can progress the lane against Renekton favorably.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high self-healing capabilities and very high durability, allowing him to gain the upper hand in long fights against Renekton's short burst trades. Renekton utilizes Fury to unleash powerful combos, but Dr. Mundo fights by consuming HP and has a large amount of healing, enabling him to withstand damage from Renekton. Additionally, Dr. Mundo has a passive that negates hard crowd control, allowing him to move freely without worrying about Renekton's stun effects.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to farm minions with Q in the early game while avoiding Renekton's combos. Use Q after Renekton uses W or misses E to trade briefly, dealing damage while healing. Furthermore, after level 6, conserve R and aim for a long fight to leverage Dr. Mundo's healing abilities while enduring Renekton's all-ins. It is crucial to avoid pushing the minion wave too much and to be mindful of enemy jungle interventions while managing health effectively.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot can utilize his range to poke Renekton while avoiding his skills, dealing damage effectively. Additionally, Urgot's ultimate has execution range, making it easier to secure kills when Renekton is low on health. Furthermore, Urgot has high base stats and percentage damage, allowing him to chip away at Renekton's durability.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, be cautious of Renekton's short combos while maintaining distance and poking with Q. If Renekton misses his W or uses his E unnecessarily, retaliate with a W-enhanced auto attack or Q, using minions to safely deal damage. After level 6, utilize Urgot's R to target low-health Renekton and coordinate with your jungler for ganks, creating even more advantageous situations. Additionally, managing the wave and luring Renekton's E dash towards your tower is crucial for playing safely under the tower.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, particularly against champions like Renekton who rely on short bursts. Singed can spread poison from a distance with his Q while avoiding Renekton's attacks, allowing him to play favorably in the early lane. Additionally, by using Singed's slows and immobilization, he can limit Renekton's movements and drag the fight into a longer engagement, continuously dealing sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane (levels 2-3), it is important not to engage directly but to spread poison from a distance with Q while using minions for defense. It is advisable to trade after the opponent has used their W or to trade under the tower to avoid Renekton's E→W combo. Furthermore, proxy farming to gain experience and scale can help establish an advantage over Renekton. In team fights, using R to increase durability and create chaos in the frontline allows allies in the backline to deal damage more easily.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills, making it easier to harass Renekton. In particular, he can deal damage from a distance using his Q skill while managing Renekton's Fury. Additionally, he can cleanse CC and heal with his W skill, which gives him high survivability even when taking damage from Renekton. Furthermore, Gangplank has short cooldowns on his skills and can deal high damage in team fights, making it easier for him to gain the upper hand against Renekton.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively bully Renekton in the early game. Use the Q skill frequently and incorporate auto-attacks to harass and aim to chip away at Renekton's HP. Also, focus on poking at early levels and play aggressively to attempt zoning. If Renekton retaliates, it is crucial to use the W skill to mitigate damage while healing, managing risks while continuing to farm. Playing safely without overextending until completing the Trinity Force is key to gaining an advantage in the lane against Renekton.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is very weak against Renekton in the early game, he scales infinitely in damage and durability in the late game by stacking his Q. Renekton has powerful burst damage in the early game and can gain an advantage in short trades, but Nasus becomes strong in the late game by stacking his Q, so it is important to survive safely in the early game. Additionally, Nasus's W (Wither) can reduce Renekton's attack speed and limit his movement, which can negate Renekton's strengths.\n\nTo gain the advantage, start with a Doran's Shield and health potions, focusing on regeneration. It is important to stop the minions on your side and safely stack Q under the tower. Avoid unnecessary fights, delay after Renekton uses his E and W with W (Wither), and only return 1-2 hits after he uses his skills. After level 6, once your durability increases with R, retaliate as soon as your stacks and items are ready. For items, choose tank items like Frozen Heart, Sterak's Gage, and Spirit Visage, and in team fights, use W on the front line to prioritize CC, ensuring you collect Q after engagements. Avoid risky all-ins and focus on finding openings during Renekton's burst cycle.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi demonstrates powerful combat capabilities against Renekton by dragging the fight into a long-term battle. In particular, by landing her E (Harsh Lesson), she can restrict Renekton's actions and deal sustained damage after extracting the soul. Additionally, Illaoi's R (Leap of Faith) significantly increases her damage in team fights and 1v1 situations, allowing her to outlast Renekton's short-term combos.\n\nTo gain the advantage, at the beginning of the lane (levels 1-3), it is important to avoid Renekton's attacks while waiting for opportunities to land E behind the minions. Proper wave management is crucial to avoid pushing the minions too much, which helps in evading Renekton's short-term combos. By timing E to hit after Renekton uses his E (Dash) or W (Stun), you can create opportunities to extract souls and win in prolonged skirmishes.\n\nDuring engagements, make sure to move diagonally to avoid W stuns and be cautious not to get stunned. After level 6, Illaoi's R becomes powerful, so when Renekton tries to take the initiative with Flash, Illaoi can actively counterattack. In terms of items, choosing tank-oriented gear and securing early heavy armor or toughness allows you to play favorably against Renekton.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has the ability to deal sustained damage against Renekton in the early game, and can utilize the invulnerability effect from his W to avoid Renekton's charges and stuns. Additionally, Bloodmire has sustain from his Q, making him good at maintaining the lane, allowing him to endure Renekton's attacks. Furthermore, Renekton's scaling drops off in the late game, making it easier for Bloodmire to create advantageous situations as he grows.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it is important to safely farm CS using Q on minions while forcing Renekton to use his W before counterattacking. When Renekton goes for an all-in, it is crucial to save W to avoid his CC while dealing damage with Q. After level 6, utilize R to unleash burst damage, and when Renekton engages, aim to turn the tables at the right moment with R. Additionally, if Renekton is pushing hard, trying to freeze the lane near the tower can effectively limit his movements.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nThere are several reasons why Teemo is favored against Renekton. First, Teemo's Q (Blind) effect can nullify Renekton's basic attacks. This prevents Renekton from dealing damage with his auto-attacks, allowing Teemo to safely poke. Additionally, Teemo has a passive that allows him to become invisible, giving him an advantage for ambushes and escapes.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, in the early game, it is important to poke with auto-attacks and E from behind minions, using Q to apply the blind just before Renekton's auto-attack. When Renekton engages, you can escape with W while returning an auto-attack, using minions as a shield to maintain distance and aim for a prolonged fight. After level 6, placing R in brushes or near the river to block all-ins is effective. Focus more on escaping than attacking, prioritize Nashor's Tooth in your item build, and then aim for Liandry's Anguish or Rabadon's Deathcap.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has excellent one-on-one performance against Renekton. By using Shen's E (Taunt), he can negate Renekton's attacks and avoid being stunned. Additionally, Shen's R (Global Presence) provides support capabilities that can help allies when Renekton engages, making it easier to deflect Renekton's attacks. Furthermore, Shen has skills that enhance auto-attacks and can negate them, making him strong against Renekton's normal attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize sustain by hitting Q from behind minions in the early game while avoiding engagements by monitoring Renekton's Fury. When Renekton has built up Fury, it is best to pull back without forcing an attack, use W to negate auto-attacks, and after forcing Renekton to use his W, follow up with E to taunt and encourage allies to chase. By dragging the fight into the long term, Shen can leverage his durability and support capabilities while taking advantage of Renekton's skill cooldowns to gain the upper hand.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration and sustainability, allowing him to withstand Renekton's short-term burst damage. Additionally, by utilizing Cho'Gath's silence (W) and knock-up (E), he can disrupt Renekton's skills and gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, Cho'Gath can secure CS while zoning with his Q, making him highly effective at maintaining the lane despite taking damage from Renekton.\n\nTo take advantage, during the early levels (1-3), it's important to stay behind the minions and absorb damage using Doran's Shield and potions to mitigate Renekton's attacks. Zoning with Q and safely securing CS with E while avoiding unnecessary engagements is crucial. After level 3, save W for the right moment to stop Renekton's skills and look for opportunities to counterattack. After level 6, use R to aim for one-on-one fights, and in team fights, initiate with Q followed by W, while purchasing durability items early to prepare for combat. This way, Cho'Gath can create a favorable situation against Renekton.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble can deal sustained damage to Renekton by utilizing his area-of-effect attacks and damage-over-time skills. Particularly, when Renekton approaches, Rumble can slow him down with E (Electro-Harpoon), limiting his attacks while counterattacking. Additionally, Rumble's R (Equalizer) deals damage over a wide area, making it very effective when Renekton engages in team fights or tower dives.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to maintain distance in the early game while continuously dealing damage with Q (Flamespitter) to avoid Renekton's short trades. When Renekton approaches with E, Rumble can slow him down with E (Electro-Harpoon) and counterattack while securing a shield and movement speed with W. When Renekton has Fury built up, avoid chasing him, and after level 6, use R (Equalizer) to cut off escape routes or secure damage in one-on-one situations while calling for allies to create advantageous situations. Remember to manage Overheat and always maximize your damage output, as this is the key to victory.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is strong in long trades and has a favorable passive against particularly low-durability opponents. Renekton is a champion with burst damage, but Mordekaiser has a shield and can deal sustained damage, allowing him to gain the upper hand in one-on-one combat. Additionally, Mordekaiser's R can trap Renekton in the realm of death, forcing a 1v1 situation and nullifying Renekton's strengths.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be aware of Renekton's skill cooldowns and to land E or Q after he has used his dash. Avoid fighting Renekton at full HP, especially when he is building Fury. During the laning phase, purchase Grievous Wounds early and use W for healing rather than damage reduction, allowing for sustained fighting. If you can survive the laning phase against Renekton, you will be able to fight advantageously from mid to late game.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage against Renekton, and she can effectively trade by attacking, especially when Renekton does not have Fury. Camille's W shield allows her to absorb Renekton's attacks while gaining an advantage when counterattacking. Additionally, Camille has a long-range blink, giving her high mobility in close combat, allowing her to trade while being mindful of Renekton's skill cooldowns.\n\nTo take advantage, first use Camille's W at level 1 to harass Renekton and trade while utilizing the shield. It's important to count Renekton's skill cooldowns and actively attack when he has no Fury. Engaging in short trades, hitting a minion with Q1, then attacking Renekton with W, and closing in with E to follow up with Q2 is effective. In terms of item build, choosing Doran's Blade allows for aggressive play, while opting for Doran's Shield is also a good choice if you're not confident in the matchup.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn can reduce damage and increase durability by stacking armor against Renekton. Additionally, Ornn's skills have crowd control, and his R's knock-up is particularly powerful in team fights and one-on-one situations. Furthermore, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane maintenance and allowing him to survive until he scales.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to first stack armor items. Specifically, buying Steelcaps initially and then opting for Bramble Vest is a good strategy. Once you reach level 6, hitting Q when your HP is below 70-80% and going all-in increases your chances of winning against Renekton. It is also important to engage in short trades repeatedly to gradually gain an advantage. For runes, choose Bone Plating and avoid Magical Footwear. This will allow you to fight favorably against Renekton.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has high mobility in mini form, allowing him to farm while avoiding Renekton's attacks. Additionally, by using Gnar's W (Whimsy), he can restrict Renekton's movements and gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, Gnar can safely secure last hits with his Q (Boomerang) while chipping away at Renekton's HP, making him good at prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to prioritize last hitting minions in the early game and avoid short trades with Renekton. When Renekton closes the distance with his E, it is effective to either escape with W or maintain distance while clearing minions with E. Also, being aware of Renekton's skill cooldowns and attacking when his skills are unavailable can help gain the upper hand. After 6 minutes, freezing the wave near the tower and safely stacking Q can make Gnar a powerful presence in later team fights.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control and can specifically counter Renekton's W. While Renekton is using his W, he cannot move, which gives K'Sante the opportunity to land his W during that window. Additionally, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in all-out situations, enhancing his performance in one-on-one fights, allowing him to gain the upper hand in short trades against Renekton. Furthermore, K'Sante has a shield and high durability, making it easier for him to absorb Renekton's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to play reactively at first, understanding Renekton's skill cooldowns and timing your attacks accordingly. When Renekton is low on HP, you should actively engage and aim for short trades. Also, purchasing Bramble Vest or Thornmail early can help suppress Renekton's healing capabilities. While prioritizing farming, if Renekton becomes aggressive, you can retaliate slightly but should avoid prolonged engagements. When using your ultimate, it's also crucial to lead him under the tower to avoid AOE damage.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is an AA (auto-attack) reliant champion and has strong counters against Renekton's skills. Specifically, by predicting Renekton's W and aiming for a counter, Jax can negate Renekton's attacks and deal damage. Additionally, while Renekton is strong in the early game, Jax scales better in the late game, making him more advantageous as time goes on.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to farm carefully and avoid Renekton's skills. When Renekton dashes in, immediately activate your counter to make him miss his W. Also, by forcing Renekton to use his E2, you can waste his Fury. Purchasing Ninja Tabi to increase your defense will help reduce Renekton's damage, allowing for safer trades. Furthermore, using Teleport to contribute to the team and aiming for power spikes is also crucial.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing ability against Renekton, making it particularly difficult to take damage from Renekton's attacks until level 8. Garen's Q provides a silence effect that can disable Renekton's skills, allowing him to gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, Garen's R deals true damage, which allows him to ignore Renekton's durability and deal damage effectively.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, it is important to utilize the level difference. Garen can capitalize on his power spike by reaching level 6 before Renekton, bringing him into kill range with his R. When Renekton has 100 Fury, it is wise to avoid trades and use the minion wave to reduce his Fury. Furthermore, choosing items like Ninja Tabi or Bramble Vest can help mitigate Renekton's healing while increasing Garen's durability. Considering the possibility of receiving ganks to gain an advantage, playing carefully is key to achieving victory.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes stronger as she levels up, and especially after level 6, she becomes Ranged and can deal powerful DPS. Renekton is weak at level 1, and his combo's power decreases when he doesn't have rage built up. This allows Kail to have the upper hand in early one-on-one encounters. Additionally, by utilizing Kail's R, which creates an invulnerable state, it becomes easier to avoid Renekton's powerful attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, Kail should actively harass Renekton from level 1 to level 6 while securing CS and aiming to level up. By attacking when Renekton's rage is not built up, she can gain an advantage. After level 6, she should use her Ranged attacks to maintain distance while harassing, and it is important to avoid fighting during Renekton's ultimate. Managing the wave and pushing it after Renekton uses his Q is also crucial to aim for a freeze and avoid Renekton's dash. Ultimately, she becomes stronger after level 11, so focus on surviving and scaling.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has very high short-term damage between levels 1 and 3, with a powerful combo that involves dashing in with E, dealing damage with Q, and aiming for a stun with W. While Renekton excels in extended trades, he often cannot withstand Pantheon's burst damage. Additionally, Pantheon has strong roaming capabilities, making it easier to influence other lanes.\n\nTo take advantage, approach Renekton early using E, deal damage with Q, and then aim for a stun with W. It is important to use E to create distance when Renekton tries to retaliate. Be sure to retreat as soon as your health is low and prepare to roam, which allows you to apply pressure in other lanes as well. Also, be mindful of Renekton's Fury management and attack when his Fury is low for effective trades."

  "ダリウス": {
    "name": "ダリウス",
    "beats": {
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has a passive that inflicts bleed and an E that pulls enemies in, making his sustained damage in close combat very powerful. Darius's R becomes reusable upon getting a kill, making it easier for him to aim for multi-kills in team fights. On the other hand, Tryndamere is weak against crowd control and may take damage from Darius's attacks before he can build up Fury. Additionally, the healing effect from Darius's Q is troublesome for Tryndamere. Furthermore, Darius has a short range, which means there are fewer opportunities for Tryndamere to deal damage before closing the gap.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm behind minions without overextending in the early game, managing Fury with Q to secure healing. Taking angles to avoid Darius's Q and reducing auto-attack damage with W before attacking can also be effective. Additionally, using E to maneuver over walls or dodge Q, and activating your own R in response to Darius's R can create opportunities for a comeback. Building up Fury before taking Darius's attacks and timing your counterattack is key.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in long trades and excels at dealing sustained damage with his passive. In particular, Warwick becomes more susceptible to damage as Darius can heal with his Q and stack his passive. Additionally, if Warwick is pulled in by Darius's E, the risk of taking Darius's attacks increases, and he may take significant damage before being able to utilize his healing abilities. Furthermore, Darius's R becomes available again after securing a kill, making it easier for him to aim for multi-kills in team fights, which is very troublesome for Warwick.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary engagements in the early game and manage the lane while healing by hitting minions with Q. To avoid Darius's Q, be careful not to push the wave too deep and use the side brushes to time the use of W. After level 6, it is effective to safely restrain Darius with R and attack when Darius's passive is not stacked or when you have an HP advantage. Also, consider using E to reduce incoming damage and suppress counterattacks with fear. Additionally, if the top lane is at a disadvantage, it can be effective to join the jungle to apply pressure.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has sustained damage from his passive and the ability to pull with his E, making him very strong in prolonged fights. Garen has a short range and is susceptible to Darius's attacks, making it difficult for him to approach. Additionally, once Darius stacks his bleed with his Q, Garen will continue to take sustained damage. Furthermore, Darius's R can reliably secure a finish, so it is dangerous for Garen to approach when he is low on health.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize clearing minions with E in the early game and to maneuver in a way that prevents Darius from stacking his E. After Darius uses his Q, Garen can create opportunities to deal damage with a short combo (E→Q→AA). Avoid prolonged fights, and when health is low, it is effective to aim for an immediate finish with R. Additionally, being mindful of jungle interventions and placing wards to stay alert can help Garen gain an advantage in the matchup against Darius.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is that Darius's melee damage and sustain are extremely powerful. Darius has sustained damage from his passive and can deal significant damage, especially by stacking up to 5 Hemorrhage. Additionally, Darius's E allows him to pull Yasuo in, and his W provides healing, making it difficult for Yasuo to avoid prolonged fights. Furthermore, Darius is strong in all-ins early on, and if he engages before Yasuo can get close, Yasuo quickly finds himself in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, avoid fighting alone and focus on whittling down Darius with Q while using minions to maneuver with E. By being aware of minion positioning and securing escape routes with E, Yasuo can avoid Darius's attacks. It is also important to avoid prolonged fights and use short hit-and-run tactics to prevent Darius from stacking Hemorrhage. After level 6, it is effective to aim for opportunities to counterattack with R by utilizing allies' knock-ups or Yasuo's own tornado. Leveraging jungle or support interventions to create advantageous situations against Darius is also crucial.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has a short range and low mobility, but he has a high ability to deal sustained damage, especially strong in long trades. Darius's passive provides significant sustained damage, and his ability to pull in with E followed by rapid auto-attacks is very powerful, while Irelia tends to lack damage in short trades. Additionally, Darius's R becomes reusable upon securing kills, increasing his threat in team fights. Irelia has means to negate Darius's Q healing, but it is difficult to create a favorable situation before Darius accumulates 5 stacks.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be noted:\n1. In the early lane phase, it is important to avoid risky trades and use minions to dodge Darius's Q. Attack minions with Q to avoid taking damage from Darius.\n2. It is crucial to use W to negate Darius's Q healing and reduce damage. Be aware of Darius's skill cooldowns and try to avoid short trades.\n3. Post level 6, maneuver to prevent Darius from getting 5 stacks to avoid being instantly killed by his R, and aim to engage in prolonged fights to gain an advantage.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is extremely powerful in close combat, especially due to his ability to deal sustained damage in long trades. Darius's passive bleeding effect is very troublesome for Mordekaiser when he tries to deal damage over time. Additionally, by using Darius's E, \"Apprehend,\" he can pull Mordekaiser in, increasing his opportunities to attack, and further deal damage with Darius's Q, \"Decimate.\" Furthermore, Darius's R, \"Noxian Guillotine,\" becomes available again upon securing a kill, making it easier to aim for multi-kills in team fights, creating a very tough situation for Mordekaiser.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid early fights and play safely until level 6. Only engage when Darius's E is wasted, and it is effective to poke with Q while maintaining distance. In terms of item build, prioritizing Riftmaker and purchasing Bramble Vest or Steelcaps can help reduce Darius's damage. In team fights, since Darius becomes weaker in the mid-game, take advantage of Mordekaiser's scaling potential by building the right items to fight more favorably.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in short-term skirmishes, especially in early-game close combat, where Darius's passive provides sustained damage and healing advantages. If caught by Darius's E (Apprehend), you are likely to be hit hard by his W and brought to the execution threshold of his R. While Yone has mobility, his short range makes it difficult to avoid Darius's attacks, especially in the early game when he is more susceptible to them. Additionally, Darius excels in long trades, while Yone is highly reliant on items, making it hard to counter Darius until he is properly equipped.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force trades in the early game and to prioritize attacking minions from a distance with Q. Be mindful of your positioning to avoid getting caught by Darius's E, and if you do get caught, try to avoid retaliation. After level 6, focus on either dealing burst damage with your R or safely disengaging, and prioritize purchasing boots and critical items (IE/PD) to enhance your ability to counter Darius. Additionally, managing the sides with wards and utilizing TP roams can effectively change the situation.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in long trades and excels at dealing sustained damage with his passive. In particular, when Darius pulls enemies with his E, it becomes difficult for Sion to approach. Additionally, if Darius has Ignite from level 1, it poses a significant threat to Sion. Sion has low mobility and finds it hard to avoid Darius's attacks, making him susceptible to damage. Furthermore, Darius can easily aim for multi-kills in team fights, and even though Sion has durability, he can be overwhelmed by Darius's damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to freeze the lane to avoid Darius's attacks. By using E to farm while maintaining distance, you can reduce the risk of taking damage from Darius. Waiting for the jungler's gank can also apply pressure on Darius. Once you reach level 6, ganking bot lane and contributing to team fights can be effective. Sion should avoid getting too close to Darius and maintain distance when using Q. By coordinating with the team and continuing to farm, you can prepare to counter Darius.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is extremely powerful in close combat, especially with his ability to deal sustained damage in long trades. The bleeding effect from Darius's passive often surpasses the healing methods that Gwen has, and Darius's Q spinning attack can be difficult for Gwen to avoid. Furthermore, Darius can easily aim for multi-kills in team fights, and he is likely to deal damage before Gwen can get close.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, it is important to leverage Gwen's strength at level 2 and initiate attacks early. Make sure to dash inward to avoid Darius's Q. Additionally, if you have Ignite, it is effective to attack aggressively when Darius does not have Ignite, using the minion wave to your advantage. Furthermore, securing priority in the first bush can help you gain a favorable position against Darius, while also paying attention to managing minion XP. This way, you can progress favorably in your matchup against Darius.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius, despite having a short range, has a high ability to deal sustained damage, making him particularly strong in long trades. Darius's passive bleeding effect is very troublesome for Fiora when she tries to engage in short bursts of damage. Additionally, Darius can pull enemies with his E, making it difficult for Fiora to approach. Furthermore, Darius's R becomes reusable upon securing kills, making it easier for him to aim for multi-kills in team fights, which is a significant threat to Fiora.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force attacks in the early game and to aim for vitals while avoiding Darius's skills, dealing damage with short Qs and auto-attacks. Being cautious of Darius's W and R, and saving W (Parry) to read CC for a potential stun is effective. Also, attacking after Darius uses his E can increase the chances of counterattacks. After level 6, using the ultimate to secure finishes while managing health and utilizing healing is crucial. Keeping the wave closer to the tower can also help avoid taking full combos from Darius.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has strong damage from the early game and can gain an advantage over Nasus in direct confrontations. Darius's passive and sustained damage from his W can deal significant damage before Nasus can stack his Q. Additionally, Darius's E, which pulls and slows, makes it difficult for Nasus to approach and avoid trades. Furthermore, Darius becomes a significant threat in team fights after level 6, as he can reset his ultimate upon getting a kill.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on farming and last-hitting minions without forcing trades in the early game. After Darius uses his W or is spamming his Q, actively retreat and utilize Bone Plating to reduce incoming damage. Also, after level 6, it is crucial to save your W for dodging his abilities or ultimate, and be prepared to escape with Flash or W when Darius activates his ultimate. As for items, purchasing Bramble Vest early on is effective in reducing Darius's damage.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is extremely powerful in close combat, especially due to his high sustained damage in long trades. Darius's passive provides continuous damage, and his E skill allows him to pull Illaoi in, making her susceptible to attacks. Additionally, Darius can reset his ultimate after getting a kill, making him a significant threat in team fights. Illaoi relies on her tentacle-based combat style, but if Darius closes the gap by exploiting his low mobility, she often takes damage before she can utilize her tentacles.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to use the E skill near the tentacles to avoid Darius's attacks while dealing damage. Building Frostfire can increase durability while choosing AD items to supplement damage is effective. Furthermore, using TP to gain an experience advantage is crucial to secure lane dominance and avoid giving Darius kills. It is also important to practice and become accustomed to the matchup against Darius.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius can initiate powerful long trades against Kled, who has short range and low mobility. Darius's passive provides sustained damage, and his E ability allows him to pull Kled in, making Kled more susceptible to Darius's attacks. Additionally, Darius's ultimate becomes reusable upon securing kills, making it easier for him to aim for multi-kills in team fights, which poses a significant risk for Kled when attempting an all-in.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to focus on avoiding Darius's Q in the early game and to aim for short trades. At levels 3-4, Kled can look for an all-in when Darius has thinned out the wave, but always be cautious to avoid his 5 stacks. In terms of itemization, it is important to purchase Bramble Vest or Ninja Tabi early to gain an advantage in trades against Darius. In team fights, aim to create a 5v4 situation to avoid Darius's strength and gain an advantage through macro play.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in close combat and has a high ability to deal sustained bleed damage through his passive. Darius can pull Olaf in with his E, easily follow up with his Q, and has the chance to turn the tables with his ultimate. Olaf excels in short engagements, but it is difficult for him to counter Darius's sustained damage, especially in prolonged fights when his HP is low. Additionally, Darius's skills can negate the effects of Olaf's R, making it hard for Olaf to gain an advantage against Darius even if he negates CC.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early lane phase, it is crucial to manage souls with Q to avoid taking Darius's bleed damage early and to utilize W for healing to avoid short skirmishes. Also, try to use E to limit Darius's movements and conserve his skills. In team fights, using R to negate CC while avoiding Darius's attacks and targeting other enemy carries can be effective. Furthermore, securing vision and being wary of jungle interventions can help avoid one-on-one situations with Darius.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is extremely powerful in the early game before level 9, and Urgot needs to avoid normal trades. Darius's passive provides sustained damage, and his Q has a strong healing effect, making it difficult for Urgot to deal damage in short trades. Additionally, Darius's E pull and slow make it hard for Urgot to approach, making him more susceptible to Darius's attacks. Furthermore, Urgot is highly dependent on levels, and if he falls behind early, it can be irrecoverable, leading to a continued disadvantage against Darius.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to play carefully in the early game and avoid Darius's attacks. Specifically, dodging Darius's Q can reduce his sustained damage. Managing the wave is key; if Darius is freezing the wave, it’s important not to approach recklessly and to farm using minions. When engaging in short trades, be prepared to escape with E, and avoid fights at full HP. Once Urgot has items after level 9, he can become advantageous, so it’s important to endure until then. Coordinating with the jungler and avoiding unnecessary fights can also be effective.",
      "アンベッサ": "Ambessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has a short range and low mobility, which allows Ambessa to take advantage of his dash to attack frequently, while Darius's sustained damage and CC skills make it difficult to approach him. In particular, Darius's passive provides sustained damage, and his pull ability makes it easy for Ambessa to take damage before going all-in. Additionally, Darius is strong in short trades, and if Ambessa misses his skills or gets attacked during cooldowns, he can easily find himself in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to choose \"Conqueror\" and \"Second Wind\" early on and focus on farming. After level 7, there is an opportunity to go all-in when Darius is at 3/4 HP by using skills. Also, by saving W to use when pulled by Darius, it is possible to reduce damage while counterattacking. By managing the wave near the tower and continuing to farm while avoiding Darius's attacks, it is possible to create a favorable situation after preparing items.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen is weak against Darius's sustained damage and bleed stacks. Darius can deal powerful damage in long trades, and especially in early all-ins, Shen is likely to be overwhelmed before he can stack his bleed. Additionally, if Shen is pulled in by Darius's E, he loses the opportunity to retaliate and becomes more susceptible to damage. Furthermore, Shen lacks AoE damage and his damage output in team fights relies on his allies, which puts him at a disadvantage against champions with sustained damage like Darius.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, focus on being protected by minions and safely farming CS while avoiding overextending.\n2. Be mindful of kiting from levels 1 to 3 to prevent Darius from stacking his bleed.\n3. Use E to retaliate in short auto-attack exchanges and avoid prolonged fights. It's also important to dodge Darius's skills.\n4. When the jungle comes, aim for kills with E, but prioritize safety and avoid taking unnecessary risks.\n5. After level 6, use R to support allies and avoid taking unnecessary 1v1 fights against the opponent.\n6. In the mid to late game, create a frontline in team fights and disrupt Darius's ability to deal with Shen's strengths."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce can poke from a distance and deal damage before Darius can close the gap. By using Jayce's Q skill to safely attack from behind minions, you can prevent Darius from approaching, allowing you to gain an early advantage. Additionally, while being cautious of Darius's E (pull), you can continue to poke while farming with Jayce's W, dealing sustained damage to Darius.\n\nTo take advantage, first, use your Q skill to deal damage to Darius from the start until level 2, positioning yourself to prevent him from getting close. From level 2 to 3, be mindful of Darius's short burst damage while continuing to poke and farm with W. From level 3 to 5, keep an eye on Darius's E, maintaining distance while securing vision. By having a Grievous Wounds item before Darius reaches full stacks, you can further solidify your advantage. During trades, it’s important to disengage immediately after a short skirmish, and if caught in melee range, use the knockback from your hammer to create distance.",
      "ヴェイン": "Vayne has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne possesses high mobility and chasing ability, allowing her to exploit Darius's short range and low mobility in fights. In particular, since Darius relies on sustained damage in close combat, Vayne can avoid his attacks and deal damage by using her E to knock him back against a wall. Additionally, by utilizing Vayne's R for stealth, she can increase her chances of counterattacking while avoiding Darius's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize CS behind minions in the early game and to stand outside the range of Darius's E. When Darius attacks, aim for a kill opportunity by using E to knock him against a wall. After level 6, use R to dodge Darius's attacks, and after successfully walling him with E, follow up with Q to create a favorable situation against Darius. Also, by purchasing items early and focusing on avoiding Darius's CC, you can fight more safely. In team fights, attacking from the side and crossing the frontline can increase your chances of catching Darius by isolating him.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kennen is a champion with ranged attacks, allowing him to harass while avoiding Darius's approach. Darius excels in close combat, but Kennen can maintain distance and attack using his skills, effectively neutralizing Darius's strengths. Additionally, by utilizing Kennen's passive stun effect, he can initiate favorable trades against Darius.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to first avoid Darius's E (Apprehend). After Darius uses his E, there is a cooldown, so you can take the opportunity to attack. Kennen can harass with Q (Shuriken) and deal damage with W (Thundering Shuriken) while maintaining distance with E (Flash). In team fights, using R (Slicing Maelstrom) allows him to deal damage over a wide area and disrupt Darius's healing, giving him an edge in team fights as well.\n\nIn this way, Kennen has a favorable matchup against Darius, and by choosing the right playstyle, he can increase his chances of victory.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and can fight while keeping her distance from Darius. Darius is a melee champion, and when he gets close, he can deal powerful damage, so Quinn can avoid Darius's attacks by maintaining that distance. Additionally, Quinn's burst damage from combos utilizing her passive is very effective against Darius. Furthermore, Quinn can quickly disengage with her E against Darius's pull skill, making it easier to avoid his attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to focus on minion management in the lane and use Q to deal damage while keeping distance when Darius approaches. If Darius uses Ghost, you should be prepared to escape quickly, as there may be an enemy jungler nearby. Also, using Nimbus Cloak and Ignite can enhance your ability to deny Darius. Building Blade of the Ruined King (BotRK) will allow you to fight even more favorably against Darius. By trading evenly in the lane and gaining a minion advantage, you can establish superiority over Darius.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in the lane. In particular, he can use barrels to deal damage without allowing Darius to get close, making it easier to create a favorable situation before Darius can engage in long trades. Additionally, he can disrupt Darius's healing from his Q, allowing him to deal sustained damage while diminishing Darius's strengths.\n\nTo take advantage, managing the minion wave at level 1 is crucial. If Darius is behind the minions, he risks losing experience, so aiming for an early bounce to create kill opportunities at level 3 is important. Choosing runes like Bone Plating and Cosmic Insight and playing aggressively will help counter Darius. Always keep barrels nearby, avoid Darius's Q, and utilize barrel damage. After level 6, Darius will try to all-in, so timing the explosion of barrels to deal damage is key. Also, being mindful of coordination with the jungler and not pushing the wave too much will allow for safer play.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas can attack from a distance, especially using his Q to poke Darius and deal damage. Additionally, by using his W, he can reduce incoming damage while also healing, allowing him to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, by utilizing his E and R, he can prevent Darius from closing the gap and disrupt the enemy formation, thus avoiding the close-range combat that Darius excels at.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early lane phase, attack Darius through minions with Q while maintaining health by absorbing damage with W. It is important to be cautious of Darius's E and approach him after he has used it or when his R is on cooldown. After level 6, when Darius charges in, use R to knock him back and either coordinate with allies or retreat to avoid his attacks while creating a favorable situation. Once a health advantage is established, it is effective to challenge him with the combo E→Q→AA→W while healing. Avoid close combat and maintain distance; this is the key to success.",
      "ナー": "Naut is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Naut can avoid Darius's attacks in the early game, especially in mini form, where he has high mobility. Darius has a short range and relies on melee attacks, so if Naut can maintain distance and farm minions with his Q, he can keep the lane without taking damage from Darius. Additionally, by using Naut's W (Wither), he can hinder Darius's approach and negate his strong trades.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important not to engage in a brawl with Darius in the early game and to reliably farm minions with Q. Purchasing regeneration and tank-oriented items early will increase durability, allowing Naut to withstand Darius's attacks. When Darius charges in, using W to immobilize him and coordinating with allies for a counterattack is effective. After level 6, using R to endure while stacking Q for damage can help Naut gain the upper hand against Darius. Choosing to fight under the tower will allow for even safer engagements.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nThe reason Teemo is favored against Darius is mainly due to his long-range poke ability and blind effect. Teemo's Q blind can negate Darius's basic attacks, significantly reducing his sustained damage. Additionally, Teemo can maintain distance while attacking using his W, making it difficult for Darius to close the gap. Furthermore, Teemo can go invisible, giving him an advantage for ambushes and escapes.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, Teemo should poke Darius from a distance between levels 1 and 5 while managing distance with W. When Darius approaches, Teemo can use Q to apply blind and negate his auto-attacks. After level 6, while being cautious of Darius's R kill pressure, Teemo should place mushrooms to secure vision and create escape routes. In team fights and split pushing, Teemo can use mushrooms to limit Darius's movements and continue poking to maintain an advantageous situation.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick can maintain distance from Darius and use minions to avoid Darius's attacks. Yorick's E allows for long-range poking, and by pushing minions, he can prevent Darius from getting close, enabling him to attack from outside the range of Darius's Q. Additionally, by summoning the Maiden, Yorick can overwhelm Darius with sheer numbers, especially after level 6 when he has strong damage, making it easier to gain the upper hand against Darius.\n\nTo take advantage, first push the minions from the start to the mid-game, using the Ghost and the minions for zoning. Prioritize last-hitting while poking from a distance with E. Be aware of the range of Darius's Q and avoid standing on the edge during team fights. If Darius approaches, use Ghost and W to slow him down, and counterattack with the minions and the Maiden. Avoid unnecessary 1v1s and focus on taking damage under the tower, and after level 6, it is important to engage in fights where you can definitely win using the Maiden. It is recommended to take Teleport and Flash as summoner spells.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability, allowing him to withstand Darius's sustained damage. In particular, the bleed damage from Darius's passive can be easily countered by Mundo's healing capabilities. Additionally, Mundo has a passive that negates hard crowd control, making it easier for him to maneuver against Darius's pull and slow effects, thus avoiding close encounters. Furthermore, Mundo scales well into the late game, allowing him to gain an advantage over Darius as the game progresses.\n\nTo take advantage of this matchup, from levels 1 to 3, prioritize safety by freezing the minion wave and using Q for ranged attacks to gain health while avoiding Darius's approach. From levels 3 to 5, use E to dodge Darius's attacks while positioning yourself to minimize damage. After level 6, it is crucial to use R to identify situations where you can tank damage, while avoiding Darius's skills and initiating attacks. Additionally, early investment in health and magic/physical defense can enhance your durability against Darius's attacks.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has sustained damage from a distance and can deal high damage, especially by managing his heat. Darius excels in close combat, but Rumble can harass while keeping his distance, allowing him to deal damage before Darius can get close. Additionally, Rumble's ultimate provides persistent damage and slows to enemies in the area, making it easier to limit Darius's movements and prevent him from stacking his passive.\n\nTo take advantage, start by harassing with Q from behind the minions at the beginning of the lane, while managing heat with E to maintain distance. It's important to avoid Darius's Q and be cautious not to get hit by his E. Just before overheating, conserve your skills, and when Darius reaches level 6, using your R to split him and lead him towards your allies or the tower is effective. In the mid-game, equipping items like Liandry's and health + ability power will help you maintain an advantage in prolonged fights against Darius.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon excels at aiming for a quick resolution in the early game with his burst damage and stun. Darius is strong in prolonged fights, but Pantheon can apply pressure from level 1 to 2 and secure advantageous trades against Darius by landing his stun with W. Additionally, Pantheon's E can block Darius's Q and engage, allowing him to defend against Darius's attacks while counterattacking.\n\nTo take advantage, first, actively engage Darius from level 1 to 2, aiming for short skirmishes where you can secure the stun with W. Use the positioning of minions to manage the lane, poke with Q, and immediately stun with W for short trades. When Darius tries to heal with E or Q, it's important to maintain distance and avoid prolonged fights. After level 6, check for Darius's E and R, and it is effective to avoid unnecessary skirmishes while roaming to gain an advantage.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail can attack from range after level 6, allowing her to deal sustained damage while avoiding Darius's melee attacks. Additionally, Kail's invulnerability from her ultimate can negate the damage from Darius's ultimate, giving her a significant advantage when Darius tries to secure a kill. Furthermore, Kail can use skills with slow effects to hinder Darius's approach, making it difficult for him to engage in long trades.\n\nTo take advantage of this, in the early game, avoid unnecessary attacks and farm behind the minions while positioning yourself to dodge Darius's E. Once you reach level 6, utilize your ranged attacks to harass Darius and prepare to use your ultimate to prevent lethal damage. Manage the wave to keep the enemy farming under their tower, applying pressure on Darius while creating opportunities for jungle ganks. As for items, prioritize Nashor's Tooth and Riftmaker to enhance your survivability by securing health and MR/AR. After levels 11 and 16, actively engage in team fights to deal DPS and use your ultimate to protect your allies."

      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank and excels at lane sustain. Ornn's short trades are powerful, making it easy to deal damage to Cho'Gath with E→Q or W attacks. Additionally, Ornn's R knock-up disrupts Cho'Gath's ability to cast skills, making it difficult for him to engage or disengage. Furthermore, as Ornn levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him a strong presence in the late game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force trades in the early game and prioritize securing CS from minions. Maintaining distance from Ornn with Q while using E for wave management and employing W's silence to disrupt Ornn's skill casts is effective. After level 6, using R when Ornn's HP is low can be a good opportunity to land a decisive blow. Additionally, in terms of itemization, focusing on AP with magic penetration early on and transitioning to a tankier build in the mid to late game to prioritize survivability is advisable.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Ornn's high durability and crowd control abilities. Ornn has tank characteristics and can easily negate Teemo's attacks, especially with his E knock-up and W shield. Additionally, Ornn is strong in close combat, and when Teemo tries to poke from a distance, he finds himself in a disadvantageous situation if Ornn approaches. Furthermore, Ornn's ultimate has a significant impact in team fights, posing a threat to Teemo.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to attack from behind the minions using auto-attacks and Q, and to retreat immediately if the risk is high. Additionally, placing mushrooms in the bushes to secure vision and limit Ornn's approach is effective. Furthermore, purchasing boots early allows Teemo to maintain distance and avoid Ornn's E. In team fights, it is crucial to poke from the backline and avoid directly confronting Ornn.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank, and especially as he levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him very powerful in the late game. Additionally, the combo of Ornn's CC skill E (Charge) followed by W (Breath of Fire) is very troublesome for Nar, making it difficult for him to engage. Nar has low base stats in mini form and is weak to all-ins, so he can easily find himself in a disadvantageous situation when taking damage from Ornn. Furthermore, Ornn's R (Call of the Forge God) has a powerful knock-up and can potentially negate Nar's transformation, making it difficult to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to utilize Nar's harassment ability in the early levels (1-3) while avoiding Ornn's skills and dealing damage with Q (Boomerang). Maintaining distance to avoid Ornn's W (Breath of Fire) and prioritizing farming is also necessary. After level 6, it is effective to look for opportunities to use Nar's R (GNOME's Fury) to negate Ornn's skills and time the transformation for a counterattack. In terms of item build, prioritizing tank items, especially purchasing \"Spirit Visage\" early to reduce Ornn's magic damage, is beneficial.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability and strong crowd control (CC), making him very resilient in lane. Although Quinn has mobility, she is weak against CC, and taking Ornn's skills can result in significant damage. Additionally, as Ornn levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him a powerful presence in the late game. Quinn has weak AoE damage and struggles to deal with Ornn's CC in team fights, making her disadvantage more pronounced in prolonged engagements.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Quinn to purchase armor penetration items early and aim for short bursts of damage against Ornn. Additionally, after closing the distance with her E, she should quickly attack while positioning herself to avoid Ornn's CC. Furthermore, after pushing the lane, prioritizing roaming to increase influence in other lanes can effectively help avoid one-on-one situations with Ornn.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn excels in prolonged skirmishes and sustain, and especially when he levels up, he can enhance his items, making him very powerful in the late game. Ornn's skills have crowd control, and his ultimate's knock-up is particularly strong, making him excellent at engaging in team fights and locking down enemy carries. On the other hand, Gragas has a slow skill activation, and especially his Q takes time to charge, making him susceptible to Ornn's attacks. Additionally, Gragas has low DPS against Ornn's durability and sustain, and he struggles in all-ins, which puts him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, focus on harassing Ornn from a distance using Gragas's Q and W to chip away at his sustain.\n2. Use E to approach Ornn, hit him with the barrel (Q), and then escape with E to deal damage while minimizing risk.\n3. Strengthen coordination with the jungle to apply pressure on Ornn by looking for ganks.\n4. In team fights, use R to disrupt Ornn's advance and divide the enemy team, preventing Ornn from utilizing his strengths.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn's sustained damage and the enhancement of defensive items make trading in prolonged fights unfavorable. Ornn can use his W to gain a shield and create walls with his E, preventing Malphite from closing the gap. Additionally, Ornn's R provides a knock-up that is very powerful for engaging in team fights, making it difficult for Malphite to take the initiative. Furthermore, as Ornn levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him a strong presence in the late game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, avoid risky trades and focus on safely farming while securing CS with Q.\n2. Be cautious of the positions where Ornn can create walls with his E and maneuver to avoid getting hit.\n3. After level 6, coordinate with allies to use R and fulfill your role in team fights.\n4. Build more tank-oriented items, choosing items like Sunfire and Thornmail to increase durability.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability and crowd control (CC), and especially after level 6, his R's knock-up limits Yorick's movements. Since Yorick relies on his pets, if Ornn's CC disables them, his combat ability significantly decreases. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane maintenance, and even if Yorick pushes, Ornn can quickly recover. Furthermore, Ornn can use his E to counterattack by utilizing walls, often allowing him to avoid Yorick's W and gain an advantage in trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Yorick to push minions between levels 1 and 5 to apply pressure on Ornn. Engaging in short trades using E and utilizing Ghost to deal damage while conserving Ornn's skills is effective. After level 6, using Maiden to side push and aiming for towers before Ornn can join team fights is beneficial. In terms of item build, prioritizing Trinity Force and Sterak's Gage allows Yorick to secure attack power and durability early, enhancing his strength in the matchup against Ornn.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Ornn's powerful crowd control skills and durability. Ornn has a wall knock-up with his E and a knock-up with his R, and if these skills are used effectively, Urgot becomes vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, Ornn has high tankiness, making it difficult for Urgot's damage to penetrate, which can lead to a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, allowing him to maintain his lane effectively and remain a strong presence in the late game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early game, it is crucial to poke from a distance with Q and avoid long trades with Ornn. A strategy of aiming for small trades, closing the distance with E, quickly attacking with W, and using the slow from Q to disengage in a short time is effective. It is also important to be aware of Ornn's E and R cooldowns and to time your attacks during his immobilization. Additionally, staying away from walls to avoid Ornn's crowd control can increase your chances of survival. Finally, receiving support from the jungle can also be effective in applying pressure on Ornn.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has powerful crowd control (CC), and especially the knock-up from his ultimate after level 6 is a significant threat. Jayce excels at poking from a distance, but if Ornn closes the gap with his durability and CC, the vulnerable Jayce in close combat becomes disadvantaged. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane sustain, and as he levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him strong in the late game as well. Jayce has low base stats in the early game and lacks sustained damage and CC, making it difficult to deal continuous damage to Ornn.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Jayce to utilize long-range poke from the beginning and deal damage before Ornn can get close. Maintaining distance with E, using W to limit Ornn's movements, and creating opportunities to approach while using minions as a shield are necessary strategies. Furthermore, choosing item builds like Luden's Echo or Ghostblade to deal damage early on is effective. Additionally, it is crucial to use Summoner's Flash to avoid Ornn's ultimate.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high durability and area CC of Ornn. Ornn has high sustainability in team fights, and can particularly stop Braum's engage with his R knock-up. Additionally, Ornn is strong in long trades in lane, making it likely that Braum will be countered by Ornn's E and W when trying to go for short bursts. Furthermore, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, which makes it easier for him to maintain lane and harder for Braum to create advantageous situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to avoid Ornn's skills while repeatedly engaging in short trades to deal damage. Specifically, after engaging with Q, landing an auto-attack and using W to heal can enhance sustainability. Also, after level 6, when diving into Ornn with R, timing the avoidance of Ornn's R is crucial. Additionally, receiving jungle support to apply pressure on Ornn may help gain lane control. In terms of itemization, purchasing tank items early to increase durability can be effective in enduring trades against Ornn.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Ornn's powerful CC skills and short-term damage output. Ornn can deal damage with the Q→W combo while aiming for knock-ups and knock-backs, and especially as he levels up, his power increases. In the early stages, Mundo has low durability, making him susceptible to damage from Ornn's combo. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, allowing him to maintain lane effectively and remain a strong presence in the late game. While Mundo excels in prolonged fights, receiving Ornn's CC makes it difficult for him to utilize his healing abilities.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Avoid early harassment**: By dodging Ornn's Q and W, it is important to minimize early damage and survive until leveling up. Especially until level 6, careful positioning and health management are crucial.\n\n2. **Utilize Flash and Summoners**: Before getting hit by Ornn's combo, use Flash or Summoner spells to secure an escape route and avoid dangerous situations.\n\n3. **Innovate item builds**: Purchase items with Grievous Wounds early to reduce Ornn's healing, thereby diminishing his sustainability.\n\n4. **Coordinate with the team**: Aim for ganks from the jungle to isolate Ornn, preventing him from leveraging his strengths. In team fights, position yourself to avoid Ornn's ultimate while maximizing Mundo's sustained DPS.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Dr. Mundo's disadvantages and regain an advantage in the matchup.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high early damage and excellent durability due to his passive, making it difficult for Renekton to secure early kills. Additionally, Ornn has many crowd control skills, and his ultimate's knock-up is particularly powerful, making it easy to disrupt Renekton's combos. Furthermore, as Ornn levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him a strong presence in the late game. Renekton's combo damage decreases when he has no Fury, making it harder to counter Ornn's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to start by purchasing a Cull and focusing on farming and scaling. By dodging Ornn's W and dashing to avoid the Brittle effect, you can trade more favorably. Additionally, a strategy of enduring until Ornn runs out of mana and then targeting towers can be effective. Since it is difficult for Renekton to secure early kills, it is crucial to use freezes to gain an advantage without overextending. Rushing to buy a Black Cleaver and invading the jungle can also be effective in preventing Ornn from farming.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has powerful CC from the early game and high dominance in close combat. Ornn can actively engage in short trades between levels 1 and 6, dealing damage to Kail while aiming for knock-ups with the E→W→Q combo. Kail is very weak in the early game, especially vulnerable to Ornn's attacks until she reaches level 6. Additionally, Kail lacks hard CC, making it difficult to deal with Ornn's CC, and if Ornn's R triggers a knock-up, Kail could take fatal damage.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to prioritize safely farming CS in the early lane and avoid risky trades. By using minions as a shield and utilizing E in short skirmishes, Kail can evade Ornn's attacks. Seeking help from the jungle can also alleviate pressure from Ornn. After level 11, Kail becomes stronger, so maintaining distance while dealing sustained damage with auto-attacks and ranged W, and using R to avoid fatal damage is crucial. In team fights, it is necessary to attack from the backline and maneuver to avoid Ornn's CC.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn can initiate powerful trades in the early game. Ornn's E→Q combo can deal high damage to Bloodmire, especially between levels 1 and 5, where Ornn can easily create advantageous situations. Additionally, Ornn has crowd control (CC) and can limit Bloodmire's movements with his ultimate knock-up. While Bloodmire can gain invulnerability with his W, timing is crucial to avoid Ornn's skills, and a mistake can result in significant damage.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important not to force trades in the early game and to use Q to last-hit minions to maintain lane control. To avoid Ornn's skills, focus on moving sideways and look for opportunities to attack after Ornn has used his abilities. Furthermore, after level 6, you can utilize W to dodge CC while counterattacking with E+Q, so it’s essential to seize opportunities to engage. In team fights, using R from the side to provide buffs and prolonging the fight can increase your survival rate.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Ornn's powerful CC skills and tanky durability. Ornn's R (ultimate) knock-up is a significant disruption when Set tries to engage. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane maintenance, and as he levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him strong in the late game as well. Set has limited ways to engage and is susceptible to harassment from Ornn's Q (Flame Breath) and W (Bellows Breath), especially in team fights where it becomes difficult to re-engage after being peeled off.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to time your attacks after clearing the wave to avoid Ornn's Q. You can also use recalls to quickly buy boots and freeze the wave in front of the tower, which can reduce Ornn's harassment. After level 6, you can cancel Ornn's R with your own R, so timing your engage attempt can be effective. Furthermore, equipping Hullbreaker to apply pressure in the side lane can create situations away from team fights, reducing Ornn's impact.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn can harass from a distance with his Q, which can stall the lane. Ornn's durability is also very high, with 400 armor and 4,000 HP, making it difficult for Illaoi to deal damage. Additionally, Ornn's CC skills (especially his R) make it hard for Illaoi to approach, making it challenging to utilize her tentacle attacks. Furthermore, Illaoi has low mobility, making it difficult to dodge Ornn's skills, which often puts her at a disadvantage in fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on farming until level 5 and wait for the timing when you can spam E. Purchasing Black Cleaver early to increase damage against Ornn is also effective. Additionally, using jungle ganks to pressure Ornn and timing Illaoi's R to avoid Ornn's CC is crucial. As a starting item, choosing Tear allows for more E usage, which can help reduce harassment in lane.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank and excellent support capabilities in team fights. Ornn's skills have crowd control, and his R's knock-up is particularly powerful for engaging in team fights. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, making it difficult to avoid Ornn's skills, which increases the damage he takes. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, allowing him to maintain his lane effectively and remain a strong presence in the late game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid Ornn's skills during the laning phase while dealing damage with Q and creating distance with E. Using W to aim for healing and dealing sustained damage can help make trades against Ornn more favorable. In team fights, using R to separate and isolate Ornn can neutralize his strengths. Furthermore, building magic resist items can effectively reduce Ornn's damage and increase durability."
    },
    "loses": {
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has three invulnerability skills after level 6, allowing him to effectively dodge Ornn's attacks. Additionally, K'Sante has abundant crowd control and a high ability to negate Ornn's skills. In particular, by avoiding Ornn's W, K'Sante can dodge Ornn's brittle proc and reduce damage. Furthermore, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in all-out situations, enhancing his performance in one-on-one fights, making it easier to gain the upper hand against Ornn.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to focus on farming early and making Ornn waste his skills. To mitigate Ornn's sustained poke with his Q, use W or E to dodge and reduce damage. After level 6, during all-ins, use Q3 to prevent Ornn from reactivating his R and actively trade. Additionally, by purchasing magic resistance items, K'Sante can counter Ornn in late-game fights. Taking Second Wind allows him to negate Q's poke and progress the lane favorably.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble can deal sustained damage against Ornn, making it easier to gain the upper hand in damage trades. Ornn has high durability as a tank, but Rumble's skills allow him to deal high damage consistently by managing his heat, and particularly, the slow effect from his E can hinder Ornn's approach. Additionally, Rumble's R deals continuous damage to enemies within its range, which can diminish Ornn's strengths in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, start the lane by using Q to deal small damage, and then apply a slow with E to harass safely. While being cautious of Ornn's engage and knock-up, it's important to conserve W for defense and maintain distance. After level 6, use R to pin Ornn in the center, and in team fights, aim for the carry with EQ, throwing R into narrow terrain to limit Ornn's disengage. In terms of item build, prioritize ability power and penetration to focus on reducing Ornn's tankiness.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo possesses high mobility and burst potential, allowing him to avoid Ornn's crowd control (CC). While Ornn has high durability as a tank, he lacks mobility and is susceptible to Yasuo's attacks. Additionally, Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, making it easy for him to deal sustained damage and excel at whittling down Ornn's HP. Furthermore, Yasuo can use his Wind Wall to block Ornn's Q and R, making it easier to negate Ornn's powerful CC.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, it is important to use Wind Wall to block Ornn's Q and W while trading and avoiding his skills. Positioning to avoid being hit by Ornn's E against the wall and using minions to safely engage is crucial. After level 6, it is effective to time your own R before Ornn uses his R, getting close to Ornn to deal a burst of damage. In team fights, entering from the side and using your R in conjunction with Ornn's knock-up can create opportunities to eliminate enemies instantly.",
      "トランドル": "Trundle has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle can demonstrate his strength in long fights against Ornn. With Trundle's ultimate, he can absorb Ornn's armor and increase his own durability, which raises his win rate in one-on-one encounters. Additionally, Trundle can avoid Ornn's crowd control, creating opportunities to counterattack after Ornn has used his skills.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, safely farm with Q while maintaining health with W. Be cautious of Ornn's E, and use Pillar (E) to restrict Ornn's movement, then chase with the E→Q→AA combo when he has used his skills. By dragging the fight into the long term, you can leverage Trundle's strengths, and in team fights, prioritize using your ultimate on Ornn to contribute to the entire team.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has a dash attached to all of his skills, making it easier to approach Ornn with his high mobility. Ornn has crowd control (CC), but Anbessa can use his mobility to dodge Ornn's skills and has a high short-term damage output, allowing him to gain the upper hand in trades against Ornn. Additionally, Ornn has low mobility and finds it difficult to respond to Anbessa, who has a dash.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to focus on farming between levels 1 and 3 without forcing aggressive plays, while avoiding the range of Ornn's Q and E. After level 3, you can charge your passive while using short auto-attacks and skills to perform hit-and-run tactics. Use your W before taking damage to secure a shield, allowing you to gain an advantage in short skirmishes. After level 6, it is crucial to observe Ornn's R and key skills, and to act calmly, suppressing Ornn while making the decision to use your R on the enemy carry. In team fights, it is beneficial to attack the backline with your R and to be aware of using E's slow and your passive to chase down enemies.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has a high ability to deal continuous damage in the mid to late game and possesses percentage damage that can ignore Ornn's durability. Additionally, Gwen's W makes it easier to dodge enemy attacks and avoid Ornn's CC, giving her high survivability in close combat. Furthermore, Ornn has low mobility, allowing Gwen to utilize her mobility effectively.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to prioritize CS by farming minions in the early game while avoiding Ornn's CC and charges. After level 6, use your R to close in on Ornn and safely attack with W. Time your short combos for when Ornn's CC is unavailable, dealing damage and then quickly disengaging to create a continuously advantageous situation. In team fights, you can safely engage using W and contribute to the team by slicing through enemies with R.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration capabilities and an ultimate (R) that grants him immortality, showing strong resistance to Ornn's short-term damage and crowd control (CC). Ornn will try to control Tremendous with CC, but Tremendous can use his E to disrupt Ornn's approach and leverage his healing by prolonging the fight. Additionally, Tremendous can deal sustained damage to Ornn, allowing him to gain an advantage by dragging the fight into the long term.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be cautious of Ornn's short-term damage and CC in the early game and to avoid unnecessary auto-attack trades. After level 6, once you have your core items, initiating a 1v1 fight is effective, using your R to drain durability and prolong the battle. Also, utilizing E to disrupt Ornn's approach and creatively positioning yourself can help you trade favorably. In team fights, it is crucial to isolate Ornn and quickly take him down, fulfilling the role of crushing the enemy's momentum.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has skills that enhance his basic attacks, making him particularly good at an AA (auto-attack) reliant playstyle. Ornn is a tank and is generally strong at taking damage, but Jax's high DPS (damage per second) and attack speed buffs allow him to deal sustained damage to Ornn. Additionally, Jax's E skill can negate attacks, enabling him to avoid Ornn's hits and gain an advantage in trades.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize farming in the lane while safely collecting CS (creep score) and avoiding Ornn's skills. Especially after Ornn uses his W skill, it is a good idea to time your trades when he has finished using his abilities. Furthermore, Jax becomes stronger as he levels up, so after level 6, he can actively engage Ornn. Additionally, asking for help from the jungler can increase the chances of taking down Ornn. As for items, acquiring Trinity Force early can further enhance damage and give Jax an edge over Ornn.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion can focus on farming against Ornn, and by maximizing his E, he can safely clear waves while poking Ornn. Ornn's skills require preparation to apply CC, and considering that Sion's skill activation is slow, Sion can easily engage Ornn. Additionally, Sion has a passive that allows him to continue fighting for a certain period after death, giving him high durability in lane and an advantage in prolonged battles against Ornn.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to first use E to farm and poke Ornn. Be careful not to push the wave too much towards Ornn and maneuver to avoid becoming vulnerable to ganks. In terms of item build, choosing Abyssal Mask and ideally building Sunfire or Thornmail simultaneously to counter Ornn's physical damage is recommended. After surviving the laning phase, you can contribute to the team by forcing objectives in other lanes without relying on Q.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reasons are that Yone has high mobility and DPS, making it easier to avoid Ornn's CC. Ornn is tanky and strong in close combat, but Yone can quickly create distance using his E, allowing him to attack while dodging Ornn's skills. Additionally, Yone's Q poke is effective, and he can retaliate by targeting the openings after Ornn uses his skills.\n\nTo take advantage, first poke Ornn with Q in the early lane phase and secure a safe position with E. The best time to strike is after Ornn uses his E or R; during that timing, avoid direct fights while utilizing the shield from W, and retaliate once Ornn's skills are on cooldown. Once you reach level 6, using R to split Ornn and coordinating with the jungle for a kill is effective. Also, consistently placing side wards and preparing for jungle intervention allows for a safer way to maintain the advantage.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf has an R that negates CC, allowing him to attack while avoiding Ornn's knock-up. Additionally, Olaf's attack speed and lifesteal increase as his HP decreases, giving him an edge in trades against Ornn. Furthermore, Olaf's Q can penetrate minions, making it easier to poke Ornn while he is building up.\n\nTo take advantage, it is possible to attempt an all-in at levels 1-2, but caution is needed due to the risk of failure. After level 6, it is important to force Ornn to use his Q and E combo before activating your R to corner him. Creating situations where Ornn cannot activate his Brittle will allow Olaf to fight more favorably. By starting with a Doran's Shield and focusing on farming and poking, you can gain an advantage over Ornn.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has high sustained damage and can gain the upper hand in long fights, especially against tanks like Ornn. While Ornn has crowd control, Singed can use his E for dashes and fling to escape, making it easier to avoid Ornn's attacks. Additionally, Singed excels at proxy farming, allowing him to create a gap in experience and gold while Ornn maintains the lane.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 2, avoid unnecessary confrontations and push the lane while being cautious of E dashes. After level 3, focus on proxy farming and keep an eye on the jungle while Ornn is in lane. Don’t forcefully go for the minion wave; instead, use wards to secure vision and track Ornn's movements. In team fights, act as the frontline, using fling and poison to disrupt the enemy carries and create a situation where your teammates can deal damage more easily.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is favored.\n\nNasus is extremely powerful in the late game, as his damage scales infinitely by stacking his Q. Against Ornn, he is at a disadvantage early on, but by using his Q to secure last hits on minions and accumulate stacks, he becomes stronger in the mid-game. Additionally, by using Nasus's W (Wither), he can stop Ornn's charges and blinks, creating opportunities for ganks.\n\nTo gain an advantage, it is important to freeze near the tower in the early game and minimize CS loss. Be cautious of Ornn's range and CC, and avoid unnecessary trades. As levels increase, Nasus can farm Q stacks while using W to limit Ornn's actions and apply pressure while being aware of jungle interventions. In the mid-game, if Nasus has farmed well, he can play favorably against Ornn, contributing to team fights by attacking from behind with Q and selecting targets for victory.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has high percentage damage against Ornn, allowing her to gain an edge, especially in one-on-one combat. Ornn's CC skills are powerful, but by using Fiora's W (Riposte), she can negate Ornn's CC while counterattacking. Additionally, Fiora has high mobility, enabling her to attack while dodging Ornn's skills, which reduces the risk of taking damage from Ornn.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the lane, use minions to target Ornn's Vital and harass while adjusting distance with Q. Use W just before Ornn charges in with E or when he tries to lock you down with R to negate his CC and counterattack. After forcing Ornn to use his skills, aim for an all-in with Q→R to deal significant damage. Furthermore, in terms of build, it is important to choose items that prioritize survivability, incorporating lifesteal and armor to enhance sustained combat ability.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has high damage output in the early game and can engage in powerful all-ins against Ornn, especially between levels 1 and 3. By dashing in with Kled's E and dealing damage with Q and W, he can chip away at Ornn's durability. Additionally, Kled has health recovery through re-mounting, allowing him to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first aim for lane dominance from levels 1 to 3, using minions and bushes to initiate with the E→Q/W combo. It is important to avoid risky 2v1 situations and areas where you can be trapped by terrain to evade Ornn's counterattacks. After level 6, use Kled's R to engage while involving allies, and maneuver to avoid being split up by Ornn's R. In terms of items, it is crucial to choose aggressive builds (like Black Cleaver or Ignite) and aim for an early resolution to prevent Ornn from leveraging his strengths.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven possesses high burst damage and mobility, allowing her to gain an edge in short trades against Ornn. Riven's skills can maximize damage through consecutive use, and her ultimate ability after level 6 poses a significant threat to Ornn. Additionally, Riven has ample blink abilities, making it easier to avoid Ornn's crowd control and allowing her to get in close to deal damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to engage in small trades using Q and auto-attacks in the early lane phase (levels 1-3), while avoiding Ornn's attacks with W and utilizing E's shield to sustain. After level 6, you can deal significant damage using R and follow up with Q after Ornn's E or W to initiate favorable trades against him. Managing the wave by leaving 1-2 minions to freeze it can also create a situation where Ornn cannot approach without risk. It's crucial to avoid overextending and to be mindful of jungle threats while playing.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has short to mid-range burst damage and high mobility, allowing her to trade effectively against Ornn. In particular, she excels at using her E to hook onto walls to approach Ornn and initiate short trades with her Q. Additionally, by using her R, Camille can isolate Ornn and gain an advantage in team fights. While Ornn is durable, he struggles to deal with Camille's burst damage, and if the fight drags on, Camille can become disadvantaged, making it crucial to engage in short skirmishes.\n\nTo take advantage, start by pulling the minions towards yourself in the early lane phase and trade using Q followed by an auto-attack reset. In levels 2-3, utilize the wall hook from E to engage Ornn, but be cautious of Ornn's E and W knock-ups. Once you reach level 6, you can use your R to isolate Ornn and aim for a kill. Additionally, purchasing early boots, a Blade of the Ruined King, and a Black Cleaver will enhance your penetration and mobility, creating even more advantageous situations. It's also important to manage waves, aim for tower plating, and expand your advantage through teleporting or roaming."

  "イラオイ": {
    "name": "イラオイ",
    "beats": {
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that when caught by Illaoi's E skill, he suffers from continuous damage from her tentacles. Illaoi excels at dragging fights into the long term using her tentacles, and she has high durability against Renekton's burst damage. Additionally, while Renekton is good at short trades due to his mobility, if he cannot avoid Illaoi's E, he may find himself in a disadvantageous situation. Furthermore, Renekton struggles in fights in areas without tentacles, making battles where Illaoi has deployed her tentacles particularly unfavorable for him.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to keep the following points in mind. First, Renekton should conserve his E and engage after Illaoi has used hers, increasing his chances for a counterattack. It is also crucial to avoid skirmishes near minions or tentacles and to time the destruction of Illaoi's tentacles carefully. After level 6, he can aim for a burst using his stun, so timing an all-in can be effective. Additionally, securing vision and receiving jungle support can help maintain a safer lane.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi is very strong in close combat and can initiate one-sided attacks by landing her E. In areas where Illaoi's tentacles are present, she can deal sustained damage and demonstrates overwhelming presence, especially in team fights. On the other hand, while Rumble has strong sustained damage from a distance, he is vulnerable to Illaoi's attacks in close combat, and especially after being hit by her E, he often needs to create distance, losing opportunities to attack. Additionally, Illaoi's R is powerful, making it difficult for Rumble to fight within its range.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, use minions to avoid her E and try not to take damage from Illaoi.\n2. Poke from behind minions with Q and break Illaoi's tentacles to gain an advantage in fights.\n3. Manage Heat to avoid overheating and attack with short bursts.\n4. After level 6, conserve R and use it outside of the tower to safely attack and prevent Illaoi from approaching.\n5. Request ganks and gain support from allies to counter Illaoi.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi has high healing and sustained damage, and particularly when hit by her E skill, \"Test of Spirit,\" Jax takes significant damage. In fights within the area where Illaoi's tentacles are present, it becomes difficult for Jax to land attacks, while he is more susceptible to damage from the tentacles. Additionally, Illaoi is very powerful in team fights, able to overwhelm Jax with AoE attacks using her tentacles. Furthermore, Jax has low base stats in the early game and is highly reliant on items, making it difficult for him to withstand Illaoi's early aggression.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Illaoi's E. Look for opportunities to attack the moment she misses it, play cautiously at levels 1-2, and aim for an all-in at level 3. As for item builds, purchasing \"Blade of the Ruined King\" early is effective for whittling down Illaoi's HP. Defensive items like \"Death's Dance\" and \"Zhonya's\" are also useful, helping to reduce Illaoi's damage. Finally, managing the wave and avoiding pressure under Illaoi's tower allows for safer farming.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that when he gets hit by Illaoi's E (Soul), it becomes difficult for Braum to approach, making him more susceptible to attacks utilizing Illaoi's tentacles. Illaoi can deal sustained damage by deploying her tentacles, and especially when tank tentacles are present, Braum's short-range attacks are not effective. Additionally, Illaoi's R (Tentacle Smash) AoE damage makes it hard for Braum to gain an advantage in team fights. Furthermore, Braum has limited mobility, making him vulnerable to Illaoi's harassment and the destruction of her tentacles.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to position yourself in a way that avoids getting hit by E in the early lane phase and to initiate your attacks before Illaoi can get close. After dodging E, engage in short skirmishes using Q and W while trying to avoid Illaoi's skills. When tank tentacles appear, move out of their range and gradually deal with them to minimize damage. Additionally, purchasing boots early can be effective in increasing your damage and durability, making it easier to take the initiative. In team fights, focus on utilizing tentacles while using sustain to endure.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi's early game damage is very high, and her E ability prevents Nasus from stacking his Q with the damage it deals. Illaoi can deal sustained damage using her tentacles, making it difficult for Nasus to approach, especially in the early game where it becomes tough to endure. Additionally, Illaoi's strength in team fights with her R can be a factor in deciding the match before Nasus can scale up.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid fighting Illaoi aggressively in the early game and prioritize stacking Q by focusing on minions. Utilizing freezing to draw the wave to the tower while avoiding Illaoi's attacks is crucial. It is also important to always be wary of her E (Illaoi's throw) and move to avoid getting hit. After level 6, it can be effective to attempt to retaliate after Illaoi has used her R or E, or to focus on farming and choose a tankier build early to increase durability.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi's attacks utilizing her tentacles are powerful, especially in team fights and laning, as she has the ability to deal sustained damage. Sett excels in close combat, but when Illaoi pulls him in with her E, he becomes more susceptible to damage. Additionally, when Illaoi's R enhances her tentacles, it becomes difficult for Sett to fight within their range, especially after level 6 when Illaoi's damage output increases, putting Sett in a disadvantageous position. Furthermore, Illaoi has strong harassment against ranged champions, making it easier for her to attack Sett from a distance and difficult for him to approach.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Fighting before level 6**: If Illaoi has only one tentacle, taking damage won't be fatal, allowing you to actively trade. If she has two tentacles, focus on taking down one early.\n\n2. **Timing of R**: After Illaoi activates her R, use your own R to push her out of the tentacle range. This can help reduce Illaoi's damage.\n\n3. **Utilizing Ignite**: Having Ignite can suppress Illaoi's healing ability, helping you to trade more favorably.\n\n4. **Avoiding E**: Always try to avoid Illaoi's E and maneuver in a way that prevents it from hitting you, which can reduce damage taken.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can mitigate Sett's disadvantages and fight more favorably.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi's E (Test of Spirit) hook attack is extremely powerful, and when hit, Illaoi can deploy her tentacles, dealing sustained damage. Illaoi has short-term burst potential, and especially when using her R (Fury of the Gods), multiple tentacles can be deployed, making Mundo susceptible to that damage. Additionally, Illaoi excels in close combat and can exploit Mundo's low mobility to initiate attacks. Furthermore, Illaoi creates situations where Mundo, who is disadvantaged against ranged champions, is more likely to be harassed.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid her E. As soon as you see Illaoi's E, try to sidestep to avoid taking damage from the tentacles. Also, it is effective to avoid short skirmishes and wait for Illaoi to miss her skills before chipping away at her with Q. Moreover, using Mundo's R (Sadism) to endure and look for counter opportunities is important. Proper wave management and consistently securing CS under the tower can help alleviate the disadvantage in lane. Finally, in team fights, maintaining the frontline while avoiding tentacles and dragging the fight into a longer engagement can allow Mundo to leverage his strengths.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Illaoi's sustained damage and healing capabilities. Illaoi deals high damage using her tentacles, and especially when she uses her ultimate, the tentacles appear, allowing her to deal continuous damage to nearby enemies while also healing herself. K'Sante excels in short bursts of damage, but in prolonged fights, he cannot withstand Illaoi's healing, especially in areas where tentacles are present. Additionally, K'Sante's E can be blocked by minions, making it difficult to dodge Illaoi's E, which is a significant handicap for K'Sante.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. It is important to use minions as a shield to block Illaoi's E and maneuver in a way that prevents her from placing tentacles.\n2. Avoid pushing the lane too hard to invite jungle intervention, which can apply pressure on Illaoi.\n3. When Illaoi activates her ultimate, it is crucial to stay out of the tentacle range and avoid being isolated.\n4. After executing a short burst of attack, quickly disengage to avoid Illaoi's counterattack.\n\nBy employing these strategies, K'Sante can alleviate his disadvantage against Illaoi and create a more favorable situation.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that in combat within the area of Illaoi's tentacles, she is very strong, making it difficult for Fiora to approach. Illaoi's E (Test of Spirit) pull and slow effects limit Fiora's mobility and reduce her chances for counterattacks. Additionally, Illaoi has high durability and can deal sustained damage using her tentacles, putting Fiora at a disadvantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, always be aware of the tentacle positions and prioritize avoiding the E. In the mid-lane phase, aim for vitals with Q and save W to time the parry against Illaoi's E. Focus on attacking in areas with fewer tentacles and aim for a quick resolution to avoid prolonged fights. Additionally, if necessary, opt for a tankier build to increase durability, which can help Fiora engage in battles against Illaoi more favorably.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi is strong in early skirmishes, especially by using her E skill to summon tentacles, which deal sustained damage. In mini form, Nar has low base stats and is weak to all-ins, making him susceptible to Illaoi's attacks. Additionally, in fights within the area where Illaoi's tentacles are present, Nar has difficulty approaching, and if he cannot avoid her E, he will find himself in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forcing engagements in the early game and focus on stacking Q using minions. Maintaining distance to avoid Illaoi's E and using W (Wither) to hinder her approach is crucial. Furthermore, coordinating with the jungler to aim for kills can apply pressure on Illaoi. Prioritizing defensive items and lifesteal, as well as returning to lane with TP to scale, can also be effective.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi has sustained damage through her tentacles and is strong in short trades. In particular, if Illaoi pulls Yone in with her E (Test of Spirit), he becomes susceptible to tentacle damage. Additionally, Illaoi has high HP and healing capabilities, making Yone disadvantaged in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Yone is highly item-dependent, and until he gets his items, fighting in lane is tough, making it difficult to counter Illaoi's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance while farming minions in the early game and to be cautious not to enter the range of her tentacles. Using E (Blade Surge) to safely approach, engaging in short trades, and quickly disengaging can help minimize damage. Also, being wary of Illaoi's E and waiting for jungle assistance from teammates can effectively prevent triggering her skills. As for items, purchasing lethality or healing reduction items early can be effective in hindering Illaoi's healing."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes Ranged after level 6, allowing her to perform powerful long-range attacks, which gives her an edge against Illaoi's melee combat style. Additionally, Kail has an R that creates an invulnerable state, enabling her to avoid Illaoi's strong attacks, making her particularly advantageous in team fights. Furthermore, Kail becomes stronger as she levels up, and especially after level 16, she functions as a very powerful carry.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to play defensively in the early lane phase and avoid unnecessary close trades. When aiming for a burst with E, prioritize attacking with a short Q from outside the tentacle range while avoiding Illaoi's E. After level 6, it is crucial to use R to protect allies and yourself while pushing to align with teammates. Additionally, managing the wave and safely farming without pushing too hard will prepare you to deal damage from the backline in team fights.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and can use his E to dodge Illaoi's tentacles. Additionally, by using Wind Wall, he can block Illaoi's E (Harsh Lesson), significantly limiting her trading ability. Furthermore, Yasuo has high burst damage and can deal significant damage to Illaoi by using his R after stacking his Q.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning, use E behind the minions to avoid direct hits from Illaoi's tentacles while prioritizing CS with Q. Once you see Illaoi's E, block it with Wind Wall and quickly engage with a short E followed by Q, then retreat. Avoid prolonged fights, and after forcing out the opponent's E and R, use Q3 or minion knock-up to land your R and attack with full force. Also, having Ignite as an item and securing Mercury's Treads and lifesteal early can help you play more advantageously.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen can easily negate Illaoi's tentacles using her ranged Q and E, allowing her to avoid close combat. While Illaoi's attacks utilizing her tentacles are powerful, Gwen can evade enemy attacks by being in the mist, which increases her survivability in team fights and 1v1 situations. Additionally, by using Gwen's E, she can create distance while trading and generate healing advantages with her W.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game, safely farm CS with Q while poking Illaoi and positioning to avoid her tentacles. Between levels 3 and 6, use E to create distance, engage in short trades, and heal with W. When Illaoi tries to target her with E, Gwen should prioritize evasion by saving her E, and if the opportunity arises, it's important to deal burst damage with E→R. In team fights, Gwen can target kill carries and isolate Illaoi to fight more favorably.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at long-range attacks, and his Q skill is particularly effective for poking. Illaoi is a champion that specializes in close combat, and her tentacle-based attacks are powerful, but Gangplank can attack from outside the range of those tentacles, allowing him to safely deal damage to Illaoi. Additionally, Gangplank can cleanse crowd control and heal with his W skill, giving him high survivability even when taking damage from Illaoi.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, you should attack with your Q skill from behind the minions and avoid getting close to Illaoi. It's important to use your E skill to dodge Illaoi's E skill. Place barrels to zone her out and force her to miss CS while staying out of tentacle range. After level 6, use your R skill to assist in side lanes or secure escape routes, creating advantageous situations while avoiding contact with Illaoi. In team fights, be mindful of the tentacle positions and attack from the outside, avoiding unnecessary face-to-face brawls.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and AoE damage, making him skilled at engaging in team fights. By eliminating Illaoi's tentacles, you can significantly reduce her damage output. Additionally, Sion's CC skill from his E can restrict Illaoi's movements and help you avoid her attacks. Furthermore, Sion has a passive that allows him to continue fighting for a certain period after death, which also contributes to his advantage in combat.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is crucial to consistently eliminate Illaoi's tentacles. Focus on clearing waves using minions while avoiding Illaoi's E. By removing her tentacles before she reaches full build, you can halve her power. Additionally, rushing to buy Warmog's and utilizing its regeneration effect for sustained fighting is effective. Keeping your distance during Illaoi's ultimate can also diminish her power. By employing these strategies, Sion can maneuver advantageously against Illaoi.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high mobility and single-target damage, making it easier to aim for a quick resolution. If hit by Irelia's E (Trial of Spirit), it can lead to a prolonged fight, putting Tremendous at a disadvantage, so it is important to avoid the E while launching an instant attack. Additionally, Tremendous's R (Undying Rage) allows it to survive Irelia's attacks and, conversely, gain an opportunity to counterattack.\n\nTo take advantage, first choose Summoner Spells Flash and Ghost or TP, and focus on avoiding Irelia's E in the early game. In lanes 1-5, do not force an attack; instead, wait for the E to be used before counterattacking and manage health with Q. Before level 6, the moment the opponent misses E is an opportunity to attack, so keep Fury high and aim for a quick resolution with critical hits. After level 6, it is important to be cautious of Irelia's R while conserving your own R for attacks.\n\nIf hit by E, consider retreating temporarily to either aim for the spirit's disappearance or call for help from the jungle. Managing the wave and pushing it to roam or go to side lanes helps avoid prolonged 1v1s and aims for a quick resolution, which is key to fighting advantageously. As for items, purchase Tiamat, focusing on critical hits and lifesteal, and consider Executioner's Calling if the opponent's healing is strong. In team fights, it is crucial to fight outside of Irelia's R range and maintain a position where the tentacles cannot reach.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire excels in long-range sustained battles, allowing him to deal damage while avoiding Irelia's tentacles. By keeping a safe distance while being cautious of Irelia's E (Trial of Souls), he can fight without entering the range of the tentacles. Additionally, utilizing Bloodmire's Q for healing enables him to maintain his health during fights, making it easier to absorb Irelia's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, he should deal damage through minions while healing and maintaining the lane. When Irelia's E is spotted, he should keep his distance and be careful not to enter the tentacle range. It is important to chase with Q when Irelia misses her E and to prolong the fight by leveraging his sustain. Furthermore, when Irelia uses her R (Tentacle Summoning), coordinating with allies to split and attack can help gain the upper hand. Prioritizing magic resistance and HP in the early game, as well as roaming to assist side lanes, can also effectively increase overall influence.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has powerful burst damage in short-range combat, especially effective after silencing with his E followed by an auto-attack burst. Illaoi relies on a combat style using her tentacles, but Garen can silence her skills with his Q, making it easier to limit Illaoi's attacks. Additionally, Garen has high durability and excels at lane sustain, allowing him to withstand Illaoi's sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize safety in the early lane phase and avoid prolonged fights near Illaoi's tentacles. After silencing with E, perform a short auto-attack burst and retreat immediately to minimize damage. When Illaoi uses her E, you can either target the spirit or create distance to reduce tentacle damage. After level 6, avoid recklessly engaging during Illaoi's R, and aim for an all-in after taking down her tentacles to fight more favorably. Additionally, utilizing roams and side pressure can effectively influence the overall game.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high mobility and can easily avoid Illaoi's attacks by dodging her E. Additionally, Irelia's skills are effective against Illaoi with her tentacles, especially by engaging right after Illaoi misses her E, allowing for a favorable fight. While fighting in an area with Illaoi's tentacles is powerful, Irelia can reduce risk by staying outside that range while harassing.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, from levels 1 to 2, position yourself to avoid triggering E and farm CS with Q through minions. From levels 3 to 6, after Illaoi misses her E, harass with a short combo (Q→AA→Q reset) while staying outside the tentacle range. During an all-in, it's good to approach with W the moment Illaoi misses her E and then engage with E→R. Additionally, purchasing Bramble or Grievous Wounds early and effectively using Ignite can help you gain an advantage in fights.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has high durability and sustained damage, making him particularly strong in long trades. Illaoi relies on a combat style dependent on her tentacles, and her combat ability decreases in areas without tentacles. On the other hand, Mordekaiser can close the gap with his E and gain a shield with his W, making him less susceptible to damage and able to avoid Illaoi's attacks. Additionally, by using his R, he can trap Illaoi in the realm of death, creating a one-on-one situation, which is very advantageous.\n\nTo take advantage, first, focus on positioning in the lane to create situations where Illaoi has difficulty placing her tentacles. It’s good to approach with E and initiate an attack while gaining a shield with W. After Illaoi uses her E, it’s a chance to counterattack. The timing of using R is also important; by activating it before Illaoi uses her R, you can isolate her and fight on favorable terms. Furthermore, as for item build, purchasing Hexdrinker early to increase durability can help you gain an advantage in fights against Illaoi.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot is a ranged champion, allowing him to attack while maintaining distance from Illaoi's close-combat style. Urgot's skills deal percentage damage, making him particularly strong against opponents with low durability. Additionally, Urgot has crowd control (stuns and pulls) that can limit Illaoi's movements. Furthermore, Urgot excels in the early game from levels 1 to 3, enabling him to bully Illaoi in the early stages.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to bully Illaoi in the early game (levels 1-3) and push the wave back. Purchasing Executioner's Calling first can effectively suppress Illaoi's lifesteal. In the mid-game (levels 3-6), understanding Illaoi's E allows for light trades when she misses it, enabling you to push the wave back again. You can bait Illaoi's ultimate and fight safely by keeping your distance. Above level 9, it is crucial to eliminate all of Illaoi's tentacles, and you need to be mindful of the timing when using E to attack the tentacles.\n\nOverall, Urgot can play safely against Illaoi and maintain an advantageous situation by surviving until team fights begin.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and can deal powerful damage, especially when his HP is low. Additionally, by avoiding Warwick's E (Trial by Blood), he can mitigate damage from Illaoi's tentacles while dragging the fight into a prolonged engagement. When Illaoi misses her E or during its cooldown, Warwick can engage with his Q, leveraging his sustain to fight advantageously.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, in the early game, avoid standing within the range of Illaoi's tentacles to dodge her E and conserve it to reduce damage taken. When Illaoi misses her E, use Q to engage and take the fight into a long-term battle, utilizing sustain. In kill trades, use R (Infinite Duress) to isolate Illaoi while being mindful of the surrounding tentacle damage to secure kills. In team fights, it is crucial to first reduce damage taken with E, suppress the targeted enemy with R, and maintain a position that avoids being caught in area damage.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has powerful engage capabilities in short-term skirmishes, particularly against Illaoi's sustained damage from her tentacles. Malphite's R (ultimate) knock-up effect can nullify Illaoi's attacks while she is deploying her tentacles, allowing for a quick resolution. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense, making him very strong against AD champions, which helps him withstand Illaoi's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to use Q for long-range harassment in the early lane phase and avoid Illaoi's E (Test of Spirit) and W (Tentacle Smash). After level 3, aim to hit Q before Illaoi can deploy her tentacles and disengage, forcing her to waste her skills. Avoid situations where Illaoi can utilize her tentacles by grouping them with minions, and when she comes alone, use R to engage quickly for a short-term resolution. In terms of build, prioritize Bramble Vest to suppress Illaoi's healing, which helps avoid prolonged fights. In team fights, focus on isolating Illaoi and pushing her with R, while avoiding areas where she can be grouped and aiming to split her from the team.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has ranged attacks, allowing him to gain an upper hand against Illaoi's melee combat style. Specifically, by using E (Acceleration Gate) to increase his movement speed and then harassing with Q (Shock Blast), he can deal damage to Illaoi while safely maintaining distance. Additionally, by avoiding Illaoi's tentacles, he can reduce her damage, especially from levels 1 to 5, where Jayce can play more favorably.\n\nTo take advantage, start by using E at the beginning of the lane to increase movement speed and harass Illaoi with Q. It's important to keep attacking while being aware of Illaoi's tentacles and maintaining distance. After level 6, pay attention to Illaoi's R (Leap of Faith) and try to engage when her ultimate is on cooldown, attacking in hammer form. After pushing the lane, roam to secure vision, ensuring to stay alert against Illaoi's Flash E or TP. When initiating short trades, be mindful of the cooldowns of E and R, and look for openings after Illaoi uses her skills."

    "beats": {
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Garen's high durability and his ultimate skill that deals true damage. Garen can deal powerful damage in close combat, and especially with his E ability, he can silence Illaoi and prevent her from retaliating. Additionally, Illaoi has low mobility, making it difficult to avoid Garen's attacks, especially after level 6, which makes her more susceptible to his assaults. Furthermore, Illaoi's combat style relies on her tentacles, so in areas without tentacles, her combat effectiveness decreases, putting her at a disadvantage against Garen.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to manage the wave and look for opportunities to hit Garen with E when he tries to farm CS. Before Garen reaches level 6, avoid unnecessary fights and freeze the wave near the tower to make it harder for Garen to attack. Additionally, purchasing \"Warden's Mail\" early can help reduce Garen's damage and increase durability. Focusing on team play and avoiding forced 1v1s while pushing Garen to gain jungle support can also be effective. It is essential to play calmly and prioritize your role in team fights.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has powerful burst damage from the early game and can silence Nasus's abilities. Garen's Q silence makes it difficult for Nasus to retaliate with his W, and Garen's sustained damage and durability make it easy for Nasus to fall behind in early trades. Additionally, Nasus is very weak in the early game and has a hard time securing farm, so if Garen applies pressure, Nasus cannot stack effectively and his growth is delayed.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky 1v1s in the early game and safely farm minions with Q. Maintaining distance to avoid Garen's Q silence and managing health carefully is essential. Using wards to secure vision and being mindful of jungle intervention while using teleport to side push when necessary can also be effective. In the mid to late game, avoiding Garen's R while building durability items can increase survival rates in team fights.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high sustain and can fight without worrying much about Jax's E skill, especially in the mid-game. Garen's ultimate (R) deals true damage and is very powerful in one-on-one combat. Additionally, after level 6, Garen's durability increases, making it difficult for Jax to create advantageous situations. Furthermore, Garen can use his silence (Q) in close trades to prevent Jax from retaliating, making him a very tough opponent for Jax.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to manage the early waves well from level 1 to level 6, as Jax has the advantage during this time. Luring out Garen's skills and then creating distance is crucial. Choosing scaling runes and aiming to acquire items that make Jax stronger, especially getting \"Sterak's Gage\" early, is also important. In team fights, it is effective to target the timing when Garen becomes vulnerable after using his skills, utilizing CC and peel to neutralize him. Ultimately, if Garen is present, banning him or avoiding the match can also be a viable option.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high short-term burst damage, and his ability to reliably enter kill range with his R after level 6 is a threat. Gwen has a short range and is susceptible to Garen's instant damage from his Q, making trades in close combat difficult. Additionally, if Garen silences Gwen, it becomes hard for her to deal her characteristic sustained damage. Furthermore, Garen has high durability and can easily shrug off Gwen's damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to maintain distance in the early game, avoiding Garen's auto-attacks with E while managing minions. Prioritize dodging Garen's Q, and if you lack sustain, it’s advisable to carry extra potions. After level 6, using R to negate Garen's engage and relying on sustained damage can be effective. In terms of itemization, purchasing armor or health early on and focusing on mixed AP/AD resistance can enhance durability.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and sustained damage, making him particularly strong in short trades. When Garen's Q (Silence) interrupts Irelia's combo, she loses her opportunity to attack and instead takes damage from Garen. Additionally, Garen's sustained damage in close combat means that he is likely to deal damage before Irelia can use her skills. Furthermore, Garen excels in long trades, and when Irelia tries to attack during her skill cooldowns, she may find herself in a disadvantageous situation due to Garen's healing ability and true damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, prioritize minion farming and refrain from attacking when Garen's Q is active, using W to reduce incoming damage. It is also effective to time your attacks to coincide with Garen's Q cooldown and to counterattack using E for the stun. In terms of item selection, incorporating lifesteal early can provide sustained healing and help Irelia win trades against Garen. Additionally, being cautious of Garen's ultimate and managing health properly is crucial to avoid unnecessary skirmishes.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing abilities, and can particularly silence Yasuo's skill usage with his Q. Garen's E (Demacian Justice) also poses a threat with its short burst damage, making it difficult for Yasuo to approach. Additionally, Garen is strong in long trades, and Yasuo often finds himself at a disadvantage in sustained combat due to Garen's passive healing affecting Yasuo's short trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to position safely behind minions with E from levels 1 to 2, maintaining a distance to avoid Garen's Q. After level 3, look for opportunities to counterattack after Garen uses his Q or E, trading with a short Q→E. After level 6, aim for kills by coordinating your R with your ally's knock-up and executing a full combo while Garen is on cooldown. Also, be mindful not to over-rely on Wind Wall, as it cannot block Garen's Q or R, and choosing Ignite as a summoner spell can effectively increase kill pressure.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing abilities, and especially after level 11 or when he has his items, he can surpass Renekton with his powerful true damage ultimate. Additionally, Garen's Q silence can prevent Renekton from executing his skill combos, allowing Garen to trade more favorably. Furthermore, Garen has limited mobility, making it difficult for Renekton to engage in trades while managing his Fury.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively trade in the early game and deal damage while being aware of Garen's passive. It is also effective to time your counterattacks after Garen uses his W or E, taking advantage of their cooldowns. Additionally, acquiring items early, especially those that increase durability, can enhance Renekton's survivability in matchups against Garen.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has short-term burst damage and silence, and especially in the early game, when Garen silences Mundo with his Q, it becomes difficult for Mundo to retaliate. Garen's E provides sustained damage, which can diminish Mundo's healing capabilities. Additionally, Garen's R deals percentage health damage, and if used at the right moment, it can inflict fatal damage on Mundo. Furthermore, Garen's strength in close combat makes it hard for Mundo to maintain distance, often putting him at a disadvantage against Garen, especially in the early game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to engage in unnecessary fights in the early lane phase. Instead, focus on poking with your Q while being cautious of Garen's Q→E combo and retreating when necessary. Using W can help reduce continuous damage, and aiming for burst damage with E can minimize the damage taken. Additionally, activating R at level 6 can help absorb Garen's engage, allowing you to maintain your durability. Choosing Mercury's Treads and purchasing Sunfire Aegis or Spirit Visage can enhance your durability while aiming for solo or split-pushing opportunities.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has an ultimate skill (R) that deals true damage, making him particularly powerful in one-on-one combat. Additionally, when Garen closes the gap with his Q, K'Sante's skills can be silenced, making it difficult to counterattack. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range, making it hard to avoid Garen's attacks, which can lead to losing the advantage in close combat. Garen's sustained damage and healing abilities are also tough elements for K'Sante.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, first, it is important to manage the lane effectively by freezing your minions near the tower to avoid Garen's attacks. Also, purchasing a Chain Vest on your first recall is crucial to prevent being instantly killed by Garen's combo. After level 6, while being cautious of Garen's Q and E, actively engaging in attacks can help stop Garen's passive. In team fights, it is important to consider Garen's impact on the backline and to focus on your own role while taking action.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen's Q (Silence) can disable Riven's skills, making it difficult for her to execute her combos. Additionally, Garen has high durability and healing capabilities, which puts Riven at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Garen's R (Demacian Justice) deals true damage, posing a risk of instant death if Riven approaches while her HP is low.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to manage minions well in the early lane phase and provoke Garen's E (Decisive Strike) before engaging in short trades. At levels 2-3, using a short combo that includes W (Stun) to chip away at Garen's HP and leveraging mobility to attack from the side to avoid Garen's Q is effective. After level 6, be cautious of Garen's R's instant death threshold, avoid approaching with low HP, and either use a blink to evade or aim to end the fight quickly.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen can deal high damage with a short combo (Q→E→R), and especially with his Q skill that silences, he can limit Braum's actions. While Braum is strong in close combat, when he is silenced by Garen, his means of dealing damage decrease, and he is unable to inflict damage on Garen in return. Additionally, Garen's passive healing effect also serves to offset the damage that Braum can deal.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to approach from behind the minions in the early lane phase and maneuver to avoid Garen's Q. By engaging in short trades and counterattacking after forcing Garen to use his skills, you can gain an advantage. Furthermore, as for item choices, purchasing Bramble Vest can help suppress Garen's healing, and having Ignite can also be effective for securing kills. After level 6, while being cautious of Garen's R, you can aim for guaranteed kills by timing your own R appropriately.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Garen's high durability and sustained damage. Garen has a healing effect from his passive, making him good at maintaining the lane. Additionally, his Q can silence Sett, making it difficult for him to use his skills, especially in one-on-one combat where Sett struggles to retaliate. Furthermore, Garen excels in long trades and is one of the champions that Sett has a hard time against. Sett has limited ways to engage, making him susceptible to Garen's attacks, and he particularly fears Garen's R, which can turn the tide with a single blow after level 6.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it's important to manage the lane well and engage Garen when he comes to collect CS, keeping the wave in your favor. It's also crucial to conserve your E and time your attacks based on Garen's W cooldown. Additionally, in terms of item build, purchasing \"Stridebreaker\" early can effectively increase damage against Garen. After level 6, be cautious of Garen's R, and avoid fighting when your HP is below 50%. In team fights, aim for Garen to split and fight separately."
    },
    "loses": {
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration and an invulnerability effect from his ultimate, making him strong in prolonged fights. Garen has short-term burst damage and can silence Tremendous to disable his skills, but Tremendous can avoid that silence, allowing him to withstand Garen's attacks and counterattack. Additionally, Tremendous can utilize Fury to increase his critical hit rate, excelling at dealing sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, use Q on minions to recover HP while maintaining distance to avoid Garen's attacks as you push the lane. After level 6, apply pressure before Garen uses his ultimate and aim for an all-in when Garen's silence is on cooldown. Particularly, by engaging after Garen uses Q or when his E is on cooldown, Tremendous can leverage his ultimate to counterattack. In team fights, split push in the side lane and target the enemy carry in team fights to create advantageous situations.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage and is strong in short trades. Against Garen, she can approach with her Q before getting silenced and escape while dealing damage with her E. Additionally, Camille's passive shield helps mitigate Garen's sustained damage. Furthermore, Camille has high mobility, making it easier to dodge Garen's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on short trades before reaching level 6, utilizing Camille's passive shield when taking Garen's Q. After level 6, it's important to be cautious of Garen's R while ensuring an escape route with E during fights. Also, by choosing the right items, there will be more opportunities to fight favorably against Garen. Using Phase Rush allows Camille to quickly create distance after attacking, helping to avoid Garen's counterattacks.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has ranged attacks and high harassment ability, allowing him to deal one-sided damage to Garen. In particular, Jayce can safely attack from behind minions using his Q (Shock Blast) and accumulate damage before Garen can approach. Additionally, by switching to his hammer, Jayce can also perform melee attacks, allowing him to land a short combo when Garen gets close and then quickly create distance. This enables him to avoid Garen's sustained damage while repeatedly applying short-term harassment.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, harass from behind minions with Q, and when Garen approaches, use E (Acceleration Gate) to maintain distance while attacking. At level 6, be mindful of Garen's R (Demolish) range, and after chipping away with Q, switch to hammer form to aim for a burst. If you determine that Garen's HP is low, it is important to use R (Transformation) to secure the kill. Additionally, building Mercury's Treads can provide a countermeasure against Garen's Q (Silence), allowing for safer gameplay.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail can attack from range after level 6, allowing her to maintain distance while attacking Garen. Garen is a melee champion and cannot deal damage unless he gets close, but Kail can hinder Garen's movement with her Q, which slows, while safely securing last hits with her E. Additionally, Kail can create an invulnerable state with her R, making it possible to avoid Garen's ultimate ability.\n\nTo take advantage, focus on safely farming CS in the early game, positioning behind minions to avoid Garen's attacks. Once you reach level 6, use your range to pressure Garen, applying the slow with Q before attacking with E. Don't overextend until your items are ready, and in team fights, focus on dealing damage while ensuring survival in one-on-one encounters with Garen by effectively using your R.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has ranged attacks, making it easier to harass Garen. In the early lane phase, Quinn can use her Q to deal chip damage to Garen while also harassing with auto-attacks. Garen can only deal damage when he gets close, allowing Quinn to initiate favorable trades during that time. Additionally, by using Quinn's E to counterattack when Garen approaches and quickly disengaging, she can avoid Garen's Q (silence).\n\nTo maintain the advantage, it's important to harass Garen with Q and auto-attacks from a distance during the laning phase, even sacrificing minions to deal damage. While being cautious of Garen's Q, if he gets close, counterattack with E and make sure to create distance immediately. After level 6, take advantage of roaming to apply pressure on other lanes, and in team fights, target the backline to maintain a favorable situation against Garen. Focus on building penetration and range to deal effective damage to Garen.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage and is strong against Garen in short trades. Although Garen has a silence, Singed can continue to deal damage while spreading poison, allowing him to take Garen's attacks while still inflicting damage. Additionally, Singed has high mobility, making it difficult for Garen to consistently engage.\n\nTo gain the advantage, at the beginning of the lane, focus on farming with poison while keeping a safe distance and being wary of Garen's Q and E. When Garen tries to engage, use Singed's W (Fling) to create distance and throw him towards the tower or your allies for a safer position. Furthermore, by choosing items like Rylai's, Liandry's, and Redemption, you can enhance your sustained damage and gain an edge in prolonged fights. After being silenced by Garen, it's important to utilize poison damage to disengage quickly.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has powerful crowd control, and particularly with his E (Feral Scream), he can manage minions while limiting Garen's movements. Additionally, by using Cho'Gath's Q (Rupture), he can prevent Garen from approaching and can trade more favorably. Furthermore, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration, making it easier to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, use E to manage minions, and when Garen approaches, aim for a knock-up with Q. It's important to land a short burst after Garen uses his Q or when he has exhausted his E. After level 6, using R (Feast) to target a low-health Garen ensures the elimination of a threat. Additionally, starting with physical defense items can reduce Garen's damage, allowing for a more favorable position. By managing distance and attacking after forcing Garen to use his E, you can maximize Cho'Gath's strengths.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser is strong in long trades and can shut down Garen's main source of damage, his Q, making it easier to gain the upper hand in one-on-one combat. Additionally, Mordekaiser's passive provides sustained damage and a shield effect, allowing him to withstand Garen's attacks more easily, especially after level 6 when he can use his R to force a one-on-one situation. This allows him to negate Garen's ultimate while stealing the opponent's stats.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively trade before reaching level 6. By landing W just before Garen uses his Q, you can withstand his initial damage. Furthermore, when Garen approaches the tower, using R under the tower can restrict his movement and increase your chances of dealing damage. Additionally, purchasing Seeker's Armguard can reduce Garen's damage, allowing you to maintain your lane more safely. By playing aggressively, avoiding Garen's skills, and initiating trades, you can progress the lane in your favor.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire can maintain distance while fighting to avoid Garen's attacks, making it possible to dodge Garen's Q (Demacian Justice). Additionally, after being hit by Garen's E (Judgment), Bloodmire can use W (Blood Flow) to utilize healing and sustain in fights. Furthermore, Bloodmire's R (Blood Feast) can be used when taking Garen's ultimate (Demolition) to reduce damage while staying alive.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to always maintain distance in the laning phase and avoid Garen's attacks. Use E (Blood Surge) to deal damage to Garen while aiming for healing, and be mindful of Garen's passive (Courage) to time your dodges. In terms of item build, purchasing \"Rune Echo\" or \"Zhonya's Hourglass\" early to increase durability is effective. This makes it easier to gain the upper hand in trades against Garen. In team fights, it is crucial to leverage your durability on the front line, support your allies, and use R (Blood Feast) to sustain yourself.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nThere are several reasons why Teemo is advantageous against Garen. First, Teemo's Q (Blind) can negate Garen's E (Demacian Justice) and normal attacks, significantly reducing Garen's damage. Additionally, Teemo can attack from a distance, allowing him to harass Garen before he can get close, making it easier to maintain lane dominance. Furthermore, Teemo's mushrooms (R) provide zone control, limiting Garen's movements and allowing for favorable engagements in fights.\n\nTo take advantage, Teemo should use auto-attacks and Q to harass Garen from the early game, chipping away at his health. Utilizing bushes to secure vision, Teemo can blind Garen with Q when he approaches, preventing counterattacks. After level 6, Teemo can use R to restrict Garen's movements while placing mushrooms to create safe escape routes, making fights against Garen more favorable. Additionally, being aware of Garen's silence cooldown and timing attacks accordingly can allow for more effective damage output.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has a high ability to deal sustained magic damage, which is particularly effective against tank champions like Garen. Garen primarily deals physical damage and has strong burst damage in close combat, but Rumble can use his skills to attack while maintaining distance, making it easier to prevent Garen from closing in. Additionally, Rumble's E provides a slow effect that limits Garen's movement and reduces his chances to retaliate.\n\nTo take advantage, apply continuous damage with Q between levels 1 and 3 while pushing the minions to pressure Garen. Use E to prevent Garen from closing in and avoid unnecessarily prolonging a 1v1. Between levels 3 and 6, combine E and Q to chip away at Garen while saving W for shielding and mobility. It's important to manage distance since getting hit by Garen's Q (Silence) can lead to retaliation. After level 6, use R to block paths or anticipate Garen's engage to set up opportunities for an all-in. Coordinating attacks with allies is also effective.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has a strong trait for long fights due to his passive, which provides sustained bleed damage. Against Garen, he can pull him in with E and stay close, making it easy to stack bleed damage, and he can also heal with the outer edge of Q, allowing him to gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, Darius's R becomes reusable upon getting a kill, making it easier to aim for multi-kills in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use E to pull Garen in early in the lane phase and stack bleed to three stacks or more. By prolonging trades, you can accumulate damage from the bleed and chip away at Garen's health. Using E in sync with Garen's Q can disrupt his counterattack and increase your chances of dealing damage. Once you reach level 6, you can use R to secure kills, so assessing the situation and being aggressive will be the key to victory.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and multiple crowd control skills, making him particularly good at engaging in team fights and lane battles. While Garen has silence, Sion can maintain his durability while fighting by utilizing harassment with his Q and the shield from his W. Additionally, Garen's damage is primarily sustained in one-on-one situations, whereas Sion has AoE damage, allowing him to effectively deal damage to multiple enemies.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to harass in lane with Q while avoiding Garen's skills. By using W to gain a shield, Sion can better withstand Garen's attacks. Furthermore, when Garen charges in with his Q, Sion can aim for a stun with E, creating an opportunity to counterattack. Additionally, by using Sion's R to charge at Garen and aim for a knock-up, Sion can limit Garen's actions and deal damage. This way, Sion can create a favorable situation against Garen.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nar becomes strong in the late game and can increase his damage by stacking with his Q. Additionally, by using W, Wither, he can neutralize Garen's pursuit and limit his movement and attack speed, making it harder to take damage from Garen. Furthermore, in mini form, Nar has high mobility, making it easier to avoid the pressure from Garen's E.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, prioritize CS with Q and use W to strengthen your defense against Garen's E. Between levels 3 and 6, use W after Garen's Q to immobilize him, then aim for short trades with Q. After level 6, utilize R while stacking, and counterattack while avoiding Garen's attacks with Wither. In terms of items, it is important to choose Steelcaps and Thornmail, building tank items to increase durability and mitigate Garen's damage.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has high burst damage in the early game, especially between levels 1 and 3, where he can execute powerful combos. Before Garen's Q (Silence) hits, Pantheon can dive in using W and deal damage with a short combo (W→Q). Additionally, Pantheon's E can negate the damage from Garen's E (Judgment), allowing him to mitigate Garen's sustained damage. Furthermore, Pantheon excels in short trades, making it easier to secure kills before Garen can utilize his sustain.\n\nTo take advantage, first, dive onto Garen using W between levels 1 and 3 and deal damage with a short combo. After level 3, use E to predict Garen's spinning attack, blocking damage while aiming for a kill. In the mid-game, it is crucial to use R to roam to other lanes before Garen becomes strong, maintaining overall superiority. Additionally, managing waves and freezing minions in front of the enemy tower can help suppress Garen's CS (Creep Score) and sustain."

      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has the ability to deal sustained damage from a distance, particularly with the E→Q combo, which can deal high damage. Camille has a short range, making it difficult to avoid Ryze's attacks, especially between levels 1 and 5 when Ryze's Q harassment is strong. Additionally, if Camille gets caught by Ryze's snare (E), she is fragile and finds it hard to retaliate. Furthermore, Ryze's skill damage increases with mana consumption, making him even more troublesome once he is properly equipped.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to manage minions in the lane thoroughly and avoid unnecessary auto-attack trades. To dodge Ryze's E, position yourself to the side and avoid pushing the wave too much to prevent him from spamming Q. After level 6, it is effective to look for opportunities to isolate him using your R and coordinate with your jungle for burst damage. Additionally, purchasing items like Trinity Force and Black Cleaver early, while building with magic resistance in mind, can help reduce Ryze's damage.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Ryze's high sustained damage and skill rotation rate. Ryze excels at chipping away Malphite's durability because he can deal sustained damage to short-range tanks and in team fights. Additionally, Ryze's skill combo increases damage by consuming mana, and his E's snare limits Malphite's movement, making it easier to miss all-in opportunities. Furthermore, Malphite has low durability against AP champions and is vulnerable to Ryze's magic damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, focus on clearing minions with E while poking with Q, and try to avoid Ryze's skills. It is also important to use W to draw tank attention and be cautious of Ryze's skill rotation. After level 6, aim to catch Ryze with R and coordinate with teammates to gain an advantage in team fights. As for items, building HP and armor is effective in increasing durability and reducing Ryze's damage.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze can utilize skill combos to deal high DPS against Kennen, who has a short range, giving him an advantage in close combat. In particular, Ryze's combo using E and W can deal significant damage before Kennen can get close, and the snare can further restrict Kennen's movement. Additionally, since Ryze's skill damage increases with mana consumption, if the fight drags on, Kennen may struggle with mana management and potentially find himself in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS while harassing with Q without forcing attacks in the early game. Look for opportunities to attack when Ryze's skills are on cooldown, and save E to aim for a counterattack. After level 6, you can engage in short skirmishes using R and aim for a stun to counter Ryze. Building items that increase ability power and magic penetration will enhance damage, and purchasing Zhonya's can effectively prevent Ryze's burst damage. Furthermore, it is crucial to manage minions well and hope for jungle intervention to create advantageous situations.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Ryze's long-range poke ability and high DPS. Ryze can deal damage with his E, which has a splash effect, while dealing primary damage with his Q, and he can reliably root Shen with his W. Since Shen has a short range, it is difficult for him to avoid Ryze's attacks, especially in the early game, making it tough to withstand Ryze's poke. Additionally, Shen lacks AoE damage and tends to rely on his teammates for damage output in team fights, leaving him with limited means to counter Ryze's high burst damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early game, it is important to avoid taking damage under the minions and to utilize your passive and W for short trades. You can create favorable situations against Ryze by using your E after he uses his W or consumes his E bounce, and then attacking with an empowered Q. Additionally, using your R to support your teammates and prevent Ryze's roams can help maintain pressure across the map. Furthermore, by choosing items wisely and being mindful of mana management, you can make the matchup against Ryze slightly more favorable.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze is a champion with long range who excels at poking from a distance, and Nasus is very weak in the early game, making him susceptible to Ryze's continuous damage from the E→W→Q combo. Additionally, Ryze's snare makes it difficult for Nasus to approach, often resulting in him taking damage before he can engage. Furthermore, Ryze has strong roaming capabilities, which can disrupt Nasus's farming by impacting other lanes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Nasus to prioritize farming in lane and to absorb Ryze's poke. By saving his E and using W for counterattacks, he can reduce the risk of taking damage from Ryze's attacks. Additionally, farming near the tower and using TP to join teammates when necessary can help alleviate lane pressure. In terms of items, purchasing tank-oriented items early to increase durability is effective.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze can deal high DPS using skill combos against Jax, who has a short range, making his harassment particularly strong during the laning phase. Jax has no long-range attack options against Ryze's poke with Q and W, making him susceptible to harassment and difficult to farm. Additionally, Ryze's snare (E) prevents Jax from getting close, causing him to miss opportunities to engage. Furthermore, Ryze's skill damage increases with mana consumption, making him even more powerful once he has his items.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Item Build**: Purchasing Mercury's Treads early and selecting Tenacity runes can reduce Ryze's crowd control. It is also important to rush Spectral Cowl from Doran's Shield to continue farming while mitigating Ryze's poke.\n\n2. **Playstyle**: Play aggressively from levels 1-3, looking for opportunities to counterattack when Ryze makes mistakes. Continuing to farm while waiting for Ryze to run out of mana can gradually create a favorable situation.\n\n3. **Jungle Coordination**: Requesting a gank from the jungle and looking for opportunities to attack after Ryze uses his escape can apply pressure on him.\n\n4. **Rune Selection**: Choosing Hail of Blades or Electrocute can increase early damage, allowing for more favorable trades against Ryze.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, it is possible to alleviate Jax's disadvantage and progress the laning phase favorably.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has a long range and can easily chip away at K'Sante's health with his ranged attacks. K'Sante is a melee champion, and taking poke from Ryze's Q and E makes health management difficult from the early game. Additionally, Ryze has short cooldowns on his skills and deals AoE damage, making him good at wave clearing and farming, which complicates K'Sante's approach. Furthermore, Ryze's snare (CC skill) increases the risk of K'Sante being immobilized when he tries to get close.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to use minions as a shield to avoid Ryze's attacks while securing CS in the early game. Targeting a short engagement when Ryze uses his skills at levels 2-3 can be effective. Choosing items that prioritize magic resistance (MR items and Mercury's Treads) can help reduce Ryze's damage and increase durability. Additionally, after level 6, being cautious of Ryze's sustain and calling for jungle support to secure kills can be effective.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Teemo has a short range and lacks durability against Ryze's high burst damage, which often makes him struggle in close combat. After level 6, Ryze can deal significant damage with the W+E+Q combo, and even if Teemo uses his blind, it is difficult to avoid the damage from Ryze's skill combo. Additionally, Teemo relies on auto-attacks, and when his movement is restricted by Ryze's snare, he easily loses opportunities to attack.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Teemo to push the minions early and place mushrooms to secure vision. This allows him to safely deal damage while being cautious of Ryze's roams and ganks. Moreover, by conserving his blind and engaging in short trades when Ryze approaches, he can neutralize some of the damage. Furthermore, focusing on defensive items in his build to increase durability can also be effective in withstanding Ryze's attacks.",
      "ナー": "Gnar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has low base stats in Mini Gnar form, making it difficult to counter Ryze's high burst damage. Ryze can deal significant damage instantly using his skill combo, and especially in the early levels (1-3), it is hard for Gnar to avoid Ryze's skills while trying to harass. Additionally, managing Gnar's transformation is challenging; when he transforms into Mega Gnar, his mobility decreases, making him more susceptible to Ryze's skills. Furthermore, Ryze's range works to his advantage against Gnar, putting Gnar in a position where he struggles to apply pressure.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during levels 1-3, it is important not to force harassment and instead focus on farming while avoiding Ryze's skills. Next, after level 4, when transforming into Mega Gnar, it is crucial to time your approach to attack while dodging Ryze's skills. Additionally, prioritizing tank items in your build can help increase durability, allowing you to withstand Ryze's burst damage. Finally, in team fights, utilizing Gnar's ultimate to group enemies can be an effective strategy to disperse Ryze's damage.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has a longer range than Bloodmire, making it easier for Ryze to retaliate when Bloodmire tries to engage. Ryze's Q (Transfusion) and E (Rune Prison) burst damage threatens Bloodmire's durability. Additionally, Ryze has short cooldowns on his skills, allowing him to deal sustained damage, making it difficult for Bloodmire to gain control in the lane. Furthermore, if Bloodmire gets snared by Ryze's E, he loses the opportunity to counterattack and increases the risk of taking damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, between levels 1 and 2, focus on farming while avoiding Ryze's skills instead of forcing attacks. After level 3, use W (Blood Price) to dodge Ryze's E and look for counterattack opportunities. Also, manage the minions to prevent Ryze from spreading his E, which helps suppress his burst damage. Furthermore, in terms of item build, it is crucial to gather AP items early to secure damage that can counter Ryze. In team fights, utilize R (Hemoplague) to coordinate with allies and aim to take down Ryze quickly.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze's high burst damage and targeted snare CC, combined with Rumble's low mobility, create a very difficult situation. In particular, Ryze can easily aim for a burst after level 6, and Rumble lacks the mobility to avoid Ryze's ult, making him more susceptible to Ryze's attacks. Additionally, although Ryze's range is short, Rumble is a melee champion, making it difficult to approach Ryze's skill combos. Furthermore, Ryze's skills increase in damage by consuming mana, allowing for sustained damage output and creating a challenging situation for Rumble's heat management.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, during the laning phase, it is important to prioritize minion farming and aim for level 6 without forcing trades against Ryze's Q and W. Next, during Ryze's ult, it is effective to avoid direct confrontations, use bushes for positioning, and coordinate with allies' CC to counterattack. Additionally, in terms of item build, it is crucial to purchase durability items early to withstand Ryze's burst. Finally, in team fights, by avoiding Ryze's zoning while approaching from the sides and working together with teammates, Rumble can leverage his strengths.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser relies on close combat, while Ryze has high DPS and skill combos. Ryze can snare (W) Mordekaiser and deal significant damage with his combo. Additionally, Ryze's long range makes it difficult for Mordekaiser to approach, especially after level 6 when Ryze's ultimate allows for mobility, making it easier for him to isolate Mordekaiser.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Secure an advantage at level 1**: It's important to establish lane dominance at level 1 and apply pressure on Ryze to create an advantageous situation early on.\n\n2. **Coordinate with the jungler**: By working with the jungler to target Ryze, you can negate his strengths. This is especially effective after Ryze has used his snare.\n\n3. **Item build**: Choosing items like Rylai's or Iceborn Gauntlet and taking Ghost can help you attempt to close the gap. Additionally, selecting Merc Treads or Demonic Embrace can reduce damage from Ryze's skills.\n\n4. **Utilize Exhaust**: Having Exhaust can help suppress Ryze's attacks, particularly effective when receiving his skill combos.\n\n5. **Play cautiously**: It's crucial to maintain distance until level 6, poking without using skills. Hold onto your E, avoid chasing, and look for opportunities to attack while dodging Ryze's skills.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Mordekaiser's disadvantage and counter Ryze effectively.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has a long range and possesses a CC skill, W (Snare), making it difficult for Darius to approach. Darius relies on short-term burst damage, but if he cannot avoid Ryze's skills, he will continue to take damage. Additionally, Ryze's skills increase in damage with mana consumption, allowing him to deal sustained damage, which means Darius is likely to be whittled down before he can initiate a long trade. Furthermore, Ryze's mobility from his ultimate often allows him to escape when Darius tries to secure a kill, making it challenging to deal with.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force an approach in the early game and to stick to minions while avoiding Ryze's skills. When engaging in small trades, try to use Q (Critical Hit) to deal damage while dodging Ryze's abilities. After level 6, use E (Pull) to catch Ryze and look for opportunities to stack damage with W (Drain). Additionally, preparing your items early to secure health and magic resistance can help reduce Ryze's damage and increase your durability. Moreover, waiting for jungle support can increase the pressure on Ryze.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has a longer range than Braum, making it easier for Braum to take damage from Ryze before getting close. Ryze can clear minions with his Q while poking, which puts pressure on Braum in the lane. Additionally, if Braum gets snared by Ryze's W when he tries to approach, he loses the chance to retaliate and increases the risk of taking damage. Furthermore, Ryze's skill damage increases with mana consumption, making it difficult for Braum to withstand Ryze's high DPS even if he has durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early lane phase, prioritize CS without forcing pushes and position yourself to avoid Ryze's skills. It is effective to approach with Q after Ryze uses his skills, engaging in short trades with AA→W. Additionally, after level 6, using R to quickly close the distance can create opportunities to ambush Ryze. Furthermore, receiving support from the jungle can increase pressure on Ryze and allow Braum to leverage his strengths.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has high DPS and short cooldowns, making it easy for him to retaliate even when Quinn tries to trade. Additionally, Ryze's Q is his main source of damage, and since Quinn has a short range, it becomes difficult for her to avoid Ryze's attacks. Furthermore, when Quinn is snared by Ryze's E, she becomes vulnerable to his combos, especially in early trades. Ryze excels at wave clearing and becomes even stronger in the late game, so Quinn needs to create a favorable situation early on to avoid a tough matchup.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it's important to harass early and deny CS to suppress Ryze's growth. Also, avoiding standing in the minion wave is necessary to dodge Ryze's Chain Lightning (Q). Moreover, when Ryze approaches, landing a Q to execute a combo can increase the chances of dealing damage. During split-pushing, having deep vision in the enemy jungle and river to track Ryze's movements will allow for safer play.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze has a long range, high DPS from his skill combo, and guaranteed CC (snare). Ryze can deal damage while maintaining distance with the E→Q combo, making it difficult for the melee Anbessa to approach. Additionally, Ryze excels at wave clearing, which allows him to push minions and limit Anbessa's engage. Furthermore, Ryze's global teleport from his ultimate supports the movement of the entire team and gives an advantage in positioning during team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to wait behind minions to avoid Ryze's skills and engage after he uses his Q or E. Also, by timing Ryze's ultimate usage, you can aim for a snare after he uses R, thereby limiting his actions. Choosing items like Mercury's Treads or Sterak's Gage can increase durability and help withstand Ryze's burst damage. Additionally, securing vision and enhancing coordination with the jungle can apply pressure on Ryze.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ryze applies strong pressure even before level 6, causing Kail to struggle in the early game. Ryze's skill combo can deal high DPS with a short cooldown, making it difficult for Kail to handle Ryze's attacks, especially in the early game when she lacks durability. Additionally, Ryze has a long range and can attack while avoiding Kail's attacks, making it hard to maintain distance. Furthermore, when Ryze's snare (E) restricts Kail's movement, the chances for counterattacks decrease.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to acquire double MR items early to reduce Ryze's magic damage. Also, having a Doran's Shield can enhance Kail's ability to withstand early harassment. Choosing Revitalize or Second Wind can improve her healing and increase her sustainability in lane. Additionally, relying on the jungler for ganks can help alleviate pressure from Ryze and create opportunities for Kail to grow."

    "loses": {
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo excels in close-range combat and can utilize his skills to deal high DPS, making it easier to create favorable situations against Ryze. Ryze is good at poking from mid-range, but Yasuo can use Wind Wall to block Ryze's Q and W while closing in with E to create opportunities for attack. Additionally, Ryze's skills consume a lot of mana, making him prone to running out of mana from early to mid-game, whereas Yasuo can use his skills at no cost, allowing him to maintain continuous aggression.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid Ryze's E→Q combo in the early lane phase while attacking from behind minions. Look for opportunities to approach with E after Ryze has used his skills, and deal damage with Q. In wave management, even if Ryze is pushing, coordinate with your jungler to look for counterattacks or prepare for roaming while continuing to push. After level 6, Yasuo can aim for a burst with his R, so it is crucial not to force attacks while Ryze's skills are available, but rather to assess the opponent's movements before acting. In team fights, focus on avoiding Ryze's area attacks while targeting one enemy to take down, and by using Wind Wall to block Ryze's skills, you can gain the upper hand.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and AoE damage, making him skilled at engaging in team fights. Against Ryze, Sion can take advantage of his slow skill activation by avoiding Ryze's abilities while engaging in short trades, allowing him to gain an upper hand. Additionally, since Ryze has a short range, Sion can easily approach and deal damage with auto-attacks and E→Q. Furthermore, Sion's R provides a charge and knock-up that can negate Ryze's abilities, increasing his impact in team fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, focus on surviving while prioritizing minion farming in the early game, using Q to secure CS while engaging in short trades. It's important to be cautious of Ryze's W and E→Q combo and not to force engagements unnecessarily. Once you reach level 6, use your R to aim for side lanes or splits, coordinating with your teammates to participate in team fights. Choose tank-oriented items, and by bringing Bramble Vest to counter Bloodthirster, you can further enhance your durability against Ryze.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is a melee champion with high burst damage and mobility, allowing her to actively engage Ryze. In particular, she can use her E to dodge Ryze's snare while utilizing minions to engage and disengage with her Q. Additionally, since Ryze's skills have a short range, Irelia can easily avoid his attacks by closing the distance. Furthermore, Irelia's attack speed increases when she lands her skills, enabling her to deal sustained damage and take advantage of Ryze's mana management and skill cooldowns.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, in the early game, stack minions to secure Q resets while avoiding Ryze's skills and aiming for a stun with E. It’s a good idea to go for an all-in combo after Ryze uses E→Q or when he runs out of mana. Also, pushing the lane to aim for a quick one-combo and applying pressure with a side push while Ryze farms under the tower is important. In team fights, Irelia can contribute to the team by targeting priority enemies as a frontline breaker and attacking Ryze's backline.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen is a fighter specialized in close combat, and he can create advantageous situations by approaching ranged casters like Ryze. By using Garen's Q (Silence), he can disable Ryze's skills, making it possible to deal damage, especially by targeting the openings after Ryze has used his abilities. Additionally, Garen has high durability and excels at dealing sustained damage, making it easier to counterattack while taking hits from Ryze.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to silence Ryze with Q from behind the minions in the early lane phase and land a short combo (Q→E→AA). Positioning yourself to avoid Ryze's E and Q is crucial, and if Ryze tries to create distance, maintaining the wave while coordinating with the jungle for an aggressive Flash E can be effective. After level 6, utilizing Garen's ultimate skill allows for powerful damage in one-on-one situations, helping to maintain an advantage over Ryze. In terms of item selection, prioritizing Mercury's Treads and then choosing Black Cleaver or tank items can further create advantageous situations.",
      "オーロラ": "Aurora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and can safely harass and manage waves with her Q, making it easier to gain an upper hand against Ryze. Additionally, using Aurora's W allows her to easily dodge Ryze's attacks, particularly avoiding the E→Q combo. Furthermore, Aurora's R has strong crowd control in team fights, which can restrict Ryze's movements and help turn the battle in her favor.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to safely clear minions with Q and avoid direct confrontation with Ryze between levels 1 and 3. After level 3, retreat with E and use W to dodge Ryze's follow-up while stacking her passive for a long fight. After level 6, use R to create a zone, limit Ryze's movements, and coordinate with allies to trap Ryze, allowing for a favorable engagement in combat.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank and can withstand Ryze's high DPS. Ryze is a battle mage who fights using skill combos, but Ornn has crowd control (CC) and can particularly limit Ryze's movement with his R ability, which knocks up enemies. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at maintaining his lane, and as he levels up, he can enhance his allies' items, making him powerful in the late game.\n\nTo take advantage, Ornn should first approach Ryze, dealing damage with his Q while applying CC with his W to initiate trades. After Ryze uses his skills, Ornn can close the gap with his E and aim for a knock-up with his R, effectively negating Ryze's skill combo while dealing damage. Furthermore, Ornn has high HP regeneration, allowing him to sustain fights even while taking damage from Ryze. Additionally, if Ryze consumes too much mana, he becomes weaker, so it's important for Ornn to leverage this point to apply pressure.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high sustain and durability, allowing him to absorb Ryze's short-term damage effectively. Ryze excels at dealing burst damage with his skill combos, but Dr. Mundo's self-healing capabilities enable him to continuously fight even after taking Ryze's attacks. Additionally, Dr. Mundo can farm from a distance with his Q, allowing him to safely secure CS against Ryze.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to safely farm CS with Q in the early game while dealing small damage to Ryze. To avoid Ryze's snare, position yourself behind minions or use corners strategically. It is also effective to engage in short trades when Ryze has used his skills and is vulnerable. Furthermore, building magic resistance items early can reduce Ryze's damage and apply pressure as the game progresses. Additionally, preparing Grievous Wounds items can suppress Ryze's healing, giving you an edge in extended fights.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has sustainability in close combat and strong crowd control (CC), allowing him to create advantageous situations by avoiding attacks from Ryze while staying out of his range. Ryze has strong sustained damage and burst from a distance, but by using Cho'Gath's W (Silence), he can disrupt Ryze's skill casting and make trades more favorable. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration, making it easier to withstand Ryze's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to equip a Doran's Shield in the early game and maintain distance while CSing minions to avoid Ryze's E→Q burst. After level 3, save W and look for the right timing to engage in trades by silencing Ryze's skills. By using E to heal while incorporating auto-attacks, you can deal damage while enhancing your survivability. In team fights, it's crucial to spread CC at the front line while managing distance to avoid Ryze's attacks, coordinating with allies' CC to time your engagement effectively.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses high mobility and DPS, allowing him to maneuver effectively against Ryze's skill combos. Ryze has high mana consumption and low damage in the early game, creating situations where Yone can easily initiate attacks. Additionally, Ryze has a short range, enabling Yone to get close and attack, making trades with his E particularly effective.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to time your attacks when Ryze's skills are on cooldown, using W for poke while initiating trades with E. After Ryze uses his skills, zone the wave and deal damage with normal attacks using Q. Also, be mindful of how you use your skills and your positioning to avoid Ryze's snare, and if the opportunity arises, aim for a follow-up with R. This way, you can maintain an advantage over Ryze.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce can utilize his long-range attacks from the early game to harass Ryze effectively. In particular, by using his Q in Cannon form, he can deal consistent damage while avoiding Ryze's skills, putting pressure on Ryze's mana management. Additionally, Jayce has mobility from his transformation, making it easier to position himself to dodge Ryze's snare. Furthermore, since Ryze has a short range, Jayce can create advantageous situations by maintaining distance while attacking, thus avoiding Ryze's attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to push the minions early to secure distance and poke Ryze with Cannon Q. Jayce should focus on short trades and position himself to avoid Ryze's E and W. Especially after Ryze uses his skills, switching to Hammer form and using knockback can create favorable situations against Ryze. If you cannot establish an advantage before level 6, consider roaming to other lanes to make up for the difference.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high HP regeneration and the ability to become immortal with his ultimate, allowing him to withstand Ryze's burst damage. Ryze relies on cooldowns for his skills, and especially after using W (Root) or E, there is an opportunity to attack. Tremendous can take advantage of this timing to engage on Ryze. Additionally, Tremendous can use minions to dodge Ryze's skills, allowing him to secure last hits without taking damage.\n\nTo gain an advantage, it is important not to approach recklessly in the early game, but to secure last hits with E while standing behind minions to avoid Ryze's Q/E burst. After Ryze uses W or E, an opportunity to attack arises, so it's crucial to time the engagement accordingly. After level 6, save the ultimate and activate it at a moment when you can withstand Ryze's burst, then go all in to potentially eliminate Ryze instantly. As for items, consider Mercury Treads and an early resist item, focusing on critical strike chance and AD to deal damage quickly. In team fights, be cautious of Ryze's line attacks, and triggering the root first before charging in will be key to victory.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven has high burst damage and mobility, allowing her to gain an edge over Ryze, especially by engaging in short trades between levels 1 and 3. Ryze is weak against early melee attacks, and Riven can deal damage with her skill combo (Q→E→Q) and then quickly retreat. Additionally, Riven has no skill costs, enabling her to continuously apply pressure and put strain on Ryze's mana management.\n\nTo take advantage, first check the cooldown of Ryze's W at the start and farm at a distance where it cannot hit. From levels 2 to 3, Riven can initiate with a short combo, absorbing damage with E while retreating immediately. It's important to push the minions to make it difficult for Ryze to land his E→W combo and create an advantageous situation before he scales. After level 6, while being mindful of Ryze's scaling, Riven can leave the side lane to regroup, enhancing the overall strength of the team."

    "beats": {
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Aurora's high mobility and long-range poke ability. Aurora can harass from a distance with her Q and maintain distance while attacking by applying slows with her E. Additionally, she can safely maneuver using her W's stealth, making it difficult for Bloodmire to approach. Bloodmire has low DPS in the early game and struggles to withstand Aurora's long-range attacks, making it easy to lose lane control. Furthermore, Aurora's R, which controls areas, also hinders Bloodmire's ability to deal sustained damage in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to be aware of Aurora's skill cooldowns and to approach when she has used her skills. Additionally, utilizing Bloodmire's W to avoid Aurora's burst and create opportunities for counterattacks can be effective. Furthermore, to invite jungle intervention, one can approach while using minions as a shield, keeping track of Aurora's position to reduce harassment. A strategy that focuses on maintaining the lane while avoiding Aurora's skills and gradually dealing damage is required.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Aurora's high mobility and ranged attack capabilities. Aurora can harass over minions using Q and E, dealing damage before Illaoi can get close. Additionally, Aurora can use W for stealth to avoid Illaoi's E, making it difficult for Illaoi to engage in close combat. Furthermore, although Aurora lacks crowd control, she can play favorably from the early game against Illaoi, who struggles to deal sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to secure vision and keep track of Aurora's movements. Utilize bushes to look for opportunities to land E, and attack after Aurora uses W. You can also use lane minions to avoid Aurora's attacks while placing tentacles to gain an advantage in combat. Additionally, attempting ganks can apply pressure on Aurora and help push the lane in your favor.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high mobility and long-range attack capabilities that Aurora possesses. Aurora can use skills with slow effects to hinder Braum's approach, allowing her to deal damage before Braum can get close, especially in the early stages of the lane. Additionally, after marking with her Q, Aurora can continue to attack while maintaining distance with her E, making it easier to create advantageous situations even when Braum approaches. Furthermore, Aurora's R has the ability to control areas, significantly impacting team fights and critical moments.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to prioritize vision and place wards in the side bushes to keep track of Aurora's movements. In the early stages of the lane, applying pressure with small combos to prevent Aurora from conserving her skills and timing attacks after she uses her skills can be effective. Additionally, in terms of item selection, prioritizing healing and armor to reduce Aurora's damage is crucial. Finally, in team fights, positioning creatively to avoid Aurora's R and coordinating with allies to target Aurora can create advantageous situations.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and can use blinks and accelerations to avoid Warwick's attacks. Additionally, Aurora's ultimate has a wide area of effect, making it difficult for Warwick to get close. Furthermore, Aurora can use skills with slow effects to limit Warwick's movements and deal sustained damage, making it harder for Warwick to utilize his healing abilities.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky trades in the early game and prioritize healing with Q by using minions. After level 6, look for opportunities to dodge Aurora's W and aim to catch her with R. Incorporating Executioner's Calling into your build for healing countermeasures and choosing core items like BotRK or Sterak/Titanic can be effective for prolonged fights. It is also crucial to maintain vision control and maneuver while reading Aurora's movements.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Aurora's high mobility and stealth capabilities. Aurora can use her W to go stealth and retreat with her E, making it easier to avoid Ornn's attacks, creating situations where Ornn cannot deal damage even when he gets close. Additionally, Aurora excels at poking with her Q and dragging fights into a war of attrition. Ornn requires preparation to apply crowd control, and dealing with Aurora's mobility is challenging, making it necessary to aim for a quick resolution, but Aurora's positioning makes that difficult.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is important to attack when Aurora's W is on cooldown. After Aurora uses her W, she cannot go stealth for a while, so you can take advantage of that window to attack with your E or R. Also, placing wards to secure vision and track Aurora's movements can help prevent ambushes and pokes. Furthermore, Ornn can increase his durability by building armor as his first item, allowing him to trade more favorably against Aurora.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tyrndamere is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and uses long-range attacks and slow effects to hinder Tyrndamere's approach. When marked by Aurora's Q, Tyrndamere becomes more susceptible to attacks, and the slow from her E keeps her at a distance, making it easier for him to miss opportunities to attack. Additionally, Aurora's R provides area control, which is very troublesome for Tyrndamere when he tries to all-in. Furthermore, since Aurora's crowd control consists only of slows, there are limited means to negate Tyrndamere's ultimate, increasing the risk of being quickly taken down even if Tyrndamere is well-farmed.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to farm carefully in the early game and avoid Aurora's attacks. Try to safely last-hit using minions and avoid Aurora's Q. After level 6, it is effective to look for opportunities to all-in when Aurora is exhausted, using W or R. Additionally, managing vision and being wary of Aurora's W stealth can increase chances of approaching her. In terms of items, it is also important to focus on attack speed and critical hits to deal damage quickly.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has a long range and excels in poke and sustain, making it difficult for Camille to approach. When Aurora uses her E to create distance with its slow effect, Camille has fewer opportunities to deal true damage. Additionally, Aurora has high mobility and can easily evade Camille's attacks by utilizing her blink. Furthermore, Aurora's ability to create zones with her R makes it challenging for Camille to get close and deal damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, use minions to set up a Q→E combo to create opportunities to deal true damage to Aurora. Next, it is important to be cautious of Aurora's E and use walls with W to maneuver safely. Additionally, applying a slow with E before Aurora gets close can help maintain distance. Finally, in team fights, it is effective to coordinate with allies' crowd control to counterattack while avoiding Aurora's R.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and excels at harassing and dealing damage from a distance. In particular, the mark from Aurora's Q and the penetration damage can deal significant damage before Shen can get close, making it difficult for Shen to engage in close combat. Additionally, Aurora's W stealth allows her to avoid Shen's E taunt, making it harder for Shen to create advantageous situations. Furthermore, since Aurora's crowd control is only a slow, there are many situations where Shen cannot fully utilize his tankiness.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid harassment in the early lane by conserving E and using sidesteps to dodge Aurora's Q. It is also necessary to use W to auto-block and gain an advantage in auto-attack trades. When Aurora goes stealth with W, it is best not to chase recklessly, but rather to wait for her skills to be on cooldown before attempting a short engagement with E→Q. After level 6, Shen can use R to roam and protect allies, which can help turn the game in their favor.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and can use multiple escape techniques and blinks to avoid Set's attacks. Aurora's wide attack range and skills with slow effects can hinder Set's approach, making it difficult for him to get close. Additionally, Aurora has burst damage, posing a high risk of instant damage when Set tries to close in. Furthermore, since Aurora's crowd control consists only of slows, Set has limited means to hinder her approach, and once he gets peeled in team fights, it becomes challenging to re-engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to first purchase a Doran's Shield and Second Wind to reduce harassment in lane. Additionally, buying a Cloak early can significantly reduce Aurora's damage. Avoiding Aurora's AoE attacks while preparing for team fights or split strategies is also effective. Furthermore, by taking advantage of Aurora's mana issues, you can gain an advantage by approaching and attacking early. Ultimately, the goal should be to survive the early game and shine in the late game.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high mobility and poke ability that Aurora possesses. Aurora excels at long-range attacks and can deal sustained damage after marking with her Q. Additionally, if Aurora utilizes her W's stealth effect, Riven can easily miss the timing to engage. Furthermore, Aurora's R provides area control, making it difficult for Riven to approach and creating unfavorable situations in team fights. Since Riven has many skills that require movement, the slow effect from Aurora restricts her mobility, making her more susceptible to attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to apply pressure on Aurora actively between levels 1 and 3 to deal early damage. By using E to create distance while aiming for short-term combos with Q, Riven can prevent Aurora from stacking her passive. Additionally, being aware of W's cooldown and attacking after Aurora uses it can create opportunities to leverage Riven's burst damage. In team fights, it is advisable to avoid fighting within Aurora's R and instead aim to eliminate her in coordination with allies' crowd control.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and excels at dealing damage while outmaneuvering enemies using acceleration and blink. In particular, the high burst damage from Aurora's Q increases the risk of being instantly taken down, as Jax has low base health and defenses. Additionally, Aurora has crowd control with slow effects, making it difficult for Jax to close the gap and evade her attacks. Furthermore, Aurora's strength in the lane is prominent, and early-game Jax is highly reliant on items, making it particularly challenging to counter Aurora in the first 20 minutes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Aurora's Q. If successful, this creates an opportunity to attack while utilizing the cooldown of her W. Additionally, item choices such as Fleet Footwork, Doran's Shield, and Refillable Potion are advisable. Choosing D Shield and Second Wind can also be effective for sustaining. Moreover, timing an all-in attack after dodging her Q can increase the chances of countering Aurora.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and can leverage long-range poke and marks to gain an advantage over Darius. It is particularly important to approach after using Aurora's W or when her Q is on cooldown, but the slow effect from Aurora makes it difficult for Darius to close the gap. Additionally, Aurora excels in sustained fights, which is advantageous against Darius's short-term burst style. Furthermore, Aurora's R provides area control, which hinders Darius's ability to move effectively in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is crucial in the early lane to avoid Aurora's AA and Q marks while using minions to stack passive. It is also effective to time short combos (Q→E→W follow-up) by observing Aurora's W and Q cooldowns to strike quickly. Moreover, equipping armor, greaves, and bramble early for sustain is necessary, and positioning to avoid being trapped by Aurora's R in team fights is essential.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Aurora's high mobility and harassment ability from a distance. Aurora can use skills with slow effects to hinder Mordekaiser's approach, and is particularly adept at avoiding Mordekaiser's attacks by utilizing \"Beyond the Realm (W).\" Additionally, Aurora has high burst damage, which poses a risk of reducing Mordekaiser's health before he can get close. Furthermore, Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and since the cooldown of his only approach tool, E, is long, it becomes difficult to avoid Aurora's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to use minions to push the wave in order to avoid Aurora's skills. This will reduce the opportunities for Aurora to harass. Additionally, it is effective to approach after Aurora has used her skills, taking advantage of the cooldowns to deal damage with Q or E. Furthermore, in team fights, using \"Realm of Death (R)\" to bring Aurora into a 1v1 situation can increase the chances of victory. In terms of item selection, prioritizing items that enhance durability is also important to withstand Aurora's burst damage.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and excels at dealing damage from a distance. In particular, Aurora's R provides area control, making it difficult for Gwen to approach, and in team fights, it becomes hard to avoid Aurora's skills. Additionally, Gwen must be wary of the return from Aurora's Q, which makes her susceptible to damage during that time. Furthermore, Aurora's slow effect limits Gwen's mobility, making it harder for her to unleash her damage in close combat.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play the lane cautiously in the early game and avoid the return from Aurora's Q. Securing vision and being wary of Aurora's W stealth while safely farming behind minions is essential. After level 6, it is advisable to utilize Gwen's R to deal damage quickly and maneuver to avoid Aurora's skills. By building items with a focus on magic resistance and health, Gwen can withstand Aurora's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and excels at dealing damage while outmaneuvering enemies using acceleration and blinks. In particular, if Aurora has Electrocute at level 3 against Renekton, who has low magic resistance early on, there is a possibility of losing half of his HP under the tower. Additionally, since Aurora only has a slow for crowd control, she can avoid Renekton's stun, making it difficult for him to escape. Furthermore, Renekton has long cooldowns on his skills, and without Fury, the power of his combos decreases, making him more likely to be at a disadvantage in trades against Aurora.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to first acquire Stridebreaker and Swifties to enhance mobility. This will make it easier to avoid Aurora's attacks. Additionally, depending on the situation, considering items like Force of Nature or Dead Man's Plate can increase durability and improve survival rates. Furthermore, coordinating with the jungler to aggressively push Aurora can create opportunities to punish her. If Aurora plays poorly, there may be chances to win the lane, so it is important to play cautiously while looking for opportunities.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has ranged attacks and can use slow effects to hinder Singed's approach. When the area is controlled by Aurora's ultimate, it becomes difficult for Singed to enter, preventing him from dealing sustained damage. Additionally, Aurora's high mobility and blink make it easier to evade Singed's attacks and avoid short trades, putting Singed at a disadvantage in trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to keep track of Aurora's ultimate and W cooldowns and to proxy farm when they are not available. Additionally, using skills to create distance before taking damage from Aurora and securing vision to avoid ambushes can also be effective. Furthermore, in team fights, being aware of fighting outside the range of Aurora's ultimate and targeting isolated enemies can help leverage Singed's strengths.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora's high mobility and ranged attacks make it difficult for Gragas to close the gap. Aurora can attack while maintaining distance using skills with slow effects, making it easier for her to avoid Gragas's follow-up attacks after he charges in with E. Additionally, Aurora excels in prolonged fights, allowing her to counter Gragas's short-term burst style effectively. Furthermore, since Gragas has crowd control, being affected by Aurora's slows restricts his movement and increases the risk of being attacked by her.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to actively use Q to clear minions between levels 1 and 3, creating opportunities to approach Aurora with E. Additionally, using W to reduce damage while deflecting Aurora's attacks is necessary. After level 6, using R to knock Aurora back and aiming for synergy can create a significantly advantageous situation. Moreover, purchasing magic resistance items early to reduce Aurora's damage is also effective. Finally, being mindful of wave management and timing when Aurora pushes the minions can help apply pressure on her in coordination with the jungler.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aurora has high mobility and excels at poking from range. In particular, Aurora's Q allows for long-range attacks that can deal damage before Yorick can get close, making prolonged fights unfavorable for him. Additionally, Aurora's W provides stealth and her R has area effects that serve as means to avoid Yorick's attacks, making it difficult for him to fight effectively in team fights. Furthermore, Aurora has slow effects that can hinder Yorick's approach, complicating battles where he relies on his pets.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to freeze the minions early on to avoid Aurora's Q attacks. After level 6, using R to apply side pressure while managing Aurora's vision and employing split tactics in team fights without diving in can be effective. Additionally, using wards to secure vision and avoid Aurora's traps is also crucial to dodge her skills.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage. The reason for this is the high mobility and slow effect crowd control that Aurora possesses. Aurora can attack while maintaining distance using her blink abilities, making it difficult for Kennen to approach and aim for a stun. Additionally, when Aurora uses her W, Kennen becomes more susceptible to damage, increasing the risk of taking damage from Aurora in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Aurora has an advantage against melee champions, and Kennen's low durability is a significant factor.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:  \n1. **Wave Management**: It is crucial to avoid pushing the minions too much to bait out Aurora's W and to time your attacks during her cooldowns.  \n2. **Item Selection**: Purchasing magic resistance items (like Banshee's Veil or MR boots) early can effectively reduce Aurora's damage. Additionally, choosing cooldown reduction items will allow you to use your skills more frequently.  \n3. **Roaming**: Kennen can utilize his R in team fights to roam to other lanes and reduce Aurora's pressure. It is also important to coordinate with teammates to create opportunities to isolate Aurora.  \n4. **Vision Control**: To avoid Aurora's W stealth and R area, ensure you have vision and try to avoid unnecessary prolonged fights."

    "loses": {
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is a melee dive champion and can safely approach using her Q to utilize minions. Aurora's skills mainly rely on harassment from a distance, and Irelia can close that gap to avoid Aurora's attacks while using her E to apply crowd control and aim for a full combo. Additionally, Irelia's damage increases at level 6, allowing her to go all-in when Aurora has used her skills.\n\nTo take advantage, first, apply pressure in the early lane by using Q to clear minions while avoiding Aurora's Q mark. It is effective to use E to apply crowd control and aim for a full combo after Aurora uses her W or has spent her R. Also, avoid forcing your way into Aurora's R area and time your engagements based on her skill usage, which can help you gain an advantage in team fights. It is important to maintain distance, avoid Aurora's skills, safely approach using minions, and aim for a prolonged fight.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has long-range poke and burst damage, making it easy to apply pressure on Aurora in the early lane. Jayce's Q (Shock Blast) deals high damage, and by engaging in short trades to prevent Aurora from stacking her passive, you can suppress her growth. Additionally, Jayce can quickly clear minions with his E (Thundering Blow), excelling at pushing under the tower. This makes it easier for Aurora to feel pressure in the lane.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, use Q for poke without using the hammer, aiming to force Aurora to use her W (Stealth). If Aurora hides with W, it's important to use a ward to check her position and push the tower while clearing minions with E/Q. After level 6, be mindful of R (Acceleration Gate), continuously poke, and coordinate with your allies' CC to create advantageous situations against Aurora. In team fights, positioning creatively to avoid Aurora's R (Realm of the Spirits) and consistently dealing damage while utilizing your range will lead to victory.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he becomes extremely powerful in the late game by stacking his Q. Aurora excels at early harassment, but Nasus can safely farm Q behind minions, making it difficult for Aurora to land attacks. Additionally, by using Nasus's W (Wither), he can restrict Aurora's movements and ensure consistent damage.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to avoid Aurora's harassment in the early game while farming Q behind minions. When Aurora marks you with her Q, you can reduce damage by sidestepping. When Aurora uses her W (Stealth), it is crucial to maintain vision and not chase recklessly. After Nasus has sufficiently stacked his Q, he can use W to catch Aurora and create opportunities to deal damage. Freezing the minions to safely farm and becoming a powerful presence for the late game is key.",
      "アカリ": "Akali has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali possesses high mobility and burst damage, making her very strong against Aurora, who only has a slow effect as crowd control. Aurora is a mage and primarily aims for burst damage, but Akali can use her blink to avoid Aurora's attacks while getting close to deal damage. Additionally, it is difficult for Aurora to deal sustained damage, making it hard to counter Akali's burst.\n\nTo take advantage, first observe Aurora's skills between levels 1 and 3 to understand their cooldowns. After Aurora uses her skills, approach with Akali's Q and use W to create a smoke screen to obscure vision while attacking. In particular, after Aurora uses her skills, you can take advantage of the cooldown by closing in with E and executing a combo. After level 6, it is important to use R to avoid Aurora's attacks while increasing opportunities to secure kills. Additionally, receiving support from the jungle can further increase pressure on Aurora.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo possesses high mobility and DPS, and can prevent the return of Q with Wind Wall against Aurora's slow effect, allowing him to fight favorably in short skirmishes. Additionally, Aurora only has a slow for crowd control, making it difficult to deal sustained damage, which makes it easier for Yasuo to leverage his high attack power. Furthermore, by targeting the cooldowns of Aurora's skills, Yasuo can initiate advantageous trades.\n\nTo gain the advantage, Yasuo should apply pressure by using Q to hit minions between levels 1 and 3 while conserving Wind Wall and repeatedly engaging in short skirmishes. After forcing Aurora to use her W or blocking the return of Q with Wind Wall, it is effective to attack with E→Q→R. Also, to avoid being trapped by Aurora's R, Yasuo should evade from the side, and in team fights, using R in conjunction with allies' crowd control can create even more advantageous situations.",
      "ナー": "NAR has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that NAR can utilize his high mobility in mini form to avoid Aurora's attacks while harassing with Q. Additionally, Aurora only has a slow effect and lacks direct crowd control, making it easy for NAR to approach. Furthermore, in mega form, NAR has high base stats and powerful AoE damage, allowing him to dominate in team fights against Aurora.\n\nTo take advantage, first, mark Aurora with Q in the early game and harass through minions. Use E to prevent Aurora from getting close, and stack the passive to three before engaging in short trades. After using W to force Aurora to expend her skills, approach and use R to immobilize her, creating a favorable situation combined with ally crowd control. Also, when Aurora tries to create distance, shift your position with W while approaching to ensure you don't miss any opportunities.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen is strong in short skirmishes and can use his Q silence to prevent Aurora from using her skills. While Aurora has high mobility, her only crowd control is a slow, making it difficult for her to withstand Garen's sustained damage. Additionally, Garen's R deals true damage, allowing him to quickly reduce Aurora's HP, making him very powerful in one-on-one combat.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, use E to clear minions while timing Q to stop the opponent's skills. When Aurora marks with her Q, create a gap with E and initiate a short skirmish. Use W (silence) to prevent Aurora's counterattack and deal sustained damage with E. If your HP gets low, retreat for a moment, save R for when she is within kill range, and prioritize clearing minions after finishing her off. Vision control is also important, and placing deep wards to counter Aurora's W stealth is effective.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has ranged attacks and long skill range, making it easier to harass Aurora in the lane. Additionally, Gangplank's barrel combo can deal damage before Aurora can utilize her mobility, making it difficult for her to retaliate. Furthermore, Gangplank can remove crowd control with his W, allowing him to continue attacking while negating Aurora's slow effects.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to consistently attack both minions and Aurora with Q between levels 1 and 3, and to place barrels safely towards the tower from the center of the lane to chip away at her health. Proper stack management is crucial, and aiming for a one-shot combo with barrels is key, but care must be taken not to engage recklessly as Aurora's W can potentially evade it. Prioritize minion control, utilize roams and buffs to maintain the lane, and use R at the right moment to seal off Aurora's area during team fights. In the late game, once items are completed, you can apply pressure from outside the range of R with area attacks, allowing you to play favorably against Aurora.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and short-term burst damage, allowing her to harass Aurora using her range. Aurora only has a slow effect and lacks direct crowd control, making trades and escapes with Quinn's E (Vault) very effective. Additionally, in the early game, Quinn can dominate the range and pressure Aurora's mana management.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Quinn should use Q to harass from behind minions and deal damage with auto-attacks. While being cautious of Aurora's passive 3 stacks and W stealth, she should place wards to secure vision. It is important to use E for quick trades and disengage before being marked by Aurora's Q. After level 6, focus on roaming, and when Aurora uses her R, avoid engaging recklessly. In team fights, moving sideways and coordinating with allies' crowd control can effectively contain Aurora.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has an advantage. In the matchup against Aurora, Rumble is favored for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, Rumble is a melee mage who can deal high damage using his skills. While Aurora excels at poking from a distance, Rumble can apply pressure with his E (missile) while dealing melee damage with his Q. This allows Rumble to inflict damage before Aurora can get close.\n\nNext, Rumble's R (Equalizer) deals sustained damage and slows enemies within its area, creating an opportunity to turn the tide when Aurora approaches. Aurora's crowd control consists only of slows, making her very vulnerable to sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage of this, start by applying pressure to Aurora with E (missile) in the early lane phase and deal melee damage with Q. It's important to avoid close combat right after Aurora's Q mark is returned, as it will deal penetrating damage. Use W to take advantage of the shield and movement speed to escape Aurora's E slow while maintaining your approach. Once you reach level 6, charge your R and combine it with your allies' crowd control to decisively win the fight.\n\nIn this way, Rumble possesses advantageous elements against Aurora, and by playing appropriately, you can capitalize on that superiority.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility, with all skills featuring a dash, making it easy to avoid Aurora's approach or, conversely, to close in and attack. Additionally, Aurora only has slow effects and lacks direct crowd control, meaning there are no means to limit Anbessa's mobility. Furthermore, Anbessa has a high short-term damage output, making it easy to disrupt Aurora's sustained healing.\n\nTo take advantage, during the early lane phase, actively use skills to attack and disrupt Aurora's healing from her spirit. In particular, deal damage with Q and W while using E to apply slows and limit Aurora's movement. In the mid-game and beyond, use R to target Aurora's backline and suppress them, securing an advantage in team fights. Additionally, managing energy effectively and utilizing energy recovery after skill usage is crucial for maintaining continuous damage output.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control (CC), which allows her to control the movements of highly mobile mages like Aurora. Aurora only has a slow effect and lacks direct CC, making her movements easily restricted when affected by K'Sante's CC. Additionally, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in all-out situations, giving her a strong performance in one-on-one fights, making her favorable against Aurora.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to focus on farming during the laning phase while avoiding Aurora's skills to secure CS. By using K'Sante's W to gain a shield, she can withstand Aurora's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack. Furthermore, targeting Aurora's vulnerabilities after she uses her skills to deal damage with Q or E and utilizing CC to control her is effective. Additionally, building items like \"Force of Nature\" can increase magic resistance and movement speed, allowing K'Sante to gain an advantage in battles against Aurora."

      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has powerful poke from a distance, and his attacks, especially in cannon form, are very painful. Gwen is a melee champion, making it difficult to avoid Jayce's attacks, which makes her susceptible to harassment from the early game. Additionally, Jayce has a short cooldown on his skills and can deal high burst damage once he levels up and gets his items. Gwen lacks sustained damage and struggles to counter Jayce's burst in team fights. Furthermore, it is challenging to exploit Jayce's vulnerability when he switches from melee to ranged, and Gwen's skills are hard to land, which adds to her disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Jayce's skill shots. Choosing to start with E can help reduce early harassment. Additionally, aiming for a follow-up at level 6 can create opportunities to counter Jayce. Attacking when Jayce's Phase Rush effect wears off is also effective. Furthermore, using W to reduce damage in close combat and leveraging approach velocity can allow Gwen to maneuver favorably against Jayce. By employing these strategies, Gwen can increase her chances of countering Jayce.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the long-range attack capabilities and burst damage of Jayce. Jayce's poke with his cannon form is extremely powerful, allowing him to deal significant damage before Singed can close the gap. Additionally, Jayce's skills have short cooldowns, and his burst damage is particularly high in the early to mid-game, making it difficult for Singed to approach. Furthermore, Singed lacks any long-range attack options, making it hard to avoid Jayce's attacks, which increases the risk of taking heavy damage before being able to deal sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on farming safely and prioritize CS in the early game without forcing engagements. Try to hide behind minions to avoid Jayce's attacks while gradually securing CS with your Q. When using your W to approach, be mindful of the timing to dodge Jayce's skills, and plan to escape immediately after throwing your E. In the mid-game, it is crucial to build tankier items and utilize your ultimate to endure while looking for opportunities to turn the tide. Proper vision control and being aware of jungle interventions are also important to increase your chances of influencing the outcome of the game.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has strong poke from a distance and can deal continuous damage to Darius using his cannon form Q (Shock Blast). Darius has a short range and is susceptible to Jayce's attacks before he can get close, making him particularly disadvantaged in the early game. Additionally, Jayce can use his E (Knockback) to disrupt Darius's approach, allowing him to counterattack when Darius tries to catch him with his E (Apprehend). Furthermore, Jayce has a short cooldown on his skills, enabling him to initiate attacks before Darius can deal sustained damage, making it difficult for Darius to aim for a quick finish.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to forcefully engage in the early game and to endure behind the minions. Utilize the minions to reduce damage taken from Jayce's Q (Shock Blast) and look for the right timing to counterattack with E (Apprehend). Additionally, saving Flash and engaging after Jayce has used his skills can increase the chances of aiming for a quick finish. It is also advisable to wait for support or jungle assistance while focusing on securing kills reliably.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has powerful poke and burst damage from the early game. Jayce can chip away at Kail from a distance using his Q in cannon form, and he can also deal high damage with his melee attacks (hammer). Particularly, Kail is very weak in the early game and remains at a disadvantage against other champions until she reaches level 6. Additionally, Kail lacks hard CC, making it difficult to avoid Jayce's skills, and she often struggles to deal with Jayce's burst damage, especially in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to start with a Doran's Shield to increase durability. It's also crucial not to force trades and to play the lane with the awareness that you can win in the late game. Focus on avoiding Jayce's Q and look for opportunities to retaliate with your own Q after he uses his Q with the hammer. Furthermore, choosing PTA and purchasing boots early can help you gain an advantage after level 11. Utilizing Fleet Footwork for sustained harassment is also effective.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble's slow effects and sustained damage are not very effective against Jayce's ranged attacks and burst damage. Jayce can harass from level 1 using Shock Blast, and his poke with Cannon Form is particularly strong. Rumble is a melee mage with low base stats in the early game, making it difficult to counter Jayce's burst damage. Additionally, Rumble has limited escape skills, making him susceptible to follow-up attacks from Jayce's mobility-enhanced assaults using his Acceleration Gate.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to manage the wave effectively at the start of the lane to avoid Jayce's harassment and use minions to reduce damage. Use Q (Flamespitter) to clear minions and try to avoid close trades. Also, utilize W to reduce incoming damage and be careful not to waste heat. After level 6, use R (Equalizer) for zoning to disrupt Jayce's attacks, aiming for an advantage in team fights and rotations. In terms of items, choosing a build focused on sustainability and selecting items that enhance crowd control duration and burn can increase Rumble's ability to counter Jayce.",
      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce can deal high damage poke from a distance early on, making it difficult for Kennen to harass in lane. Jayce's Shock Blast and attacks using his Gate can inflict significant damage before Kennen can get close, especially between levels 1 and 5 when Kennen's base stats are low, making it hard for him to endure. Additionally, Jayce has high burst damage when switching to melee, making him strong against Kennen's all-ins when he tries to approach. Furthermore, Jayce can easily push the lane and apply pressure through roaming and side lanes, which puts Kennen in a disadvantageous position.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to position yourself cleverly between minions to avoid Jayce's Shock Blast. Gradually chip away with Q while hitting minions with W to stack your passive, and then approach with E when the opponent misses their skill. After level 6, you can leverage Kennen's R to increase your impact in team fights, so it's a good idea to focus on roaming and side lane assignments to contribute in team fights. Additionally, purchasing Zhonya's can effectively increase your survivability against Jayce's all-ins.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Jayce's long-range poke ability and high burst damage. Jayce's attacks in cannon form are powerful, allowing him to deal significant damage before Garen can close the gap. Additionally, Jayce's skills have short cooldowns and excel at managing distance, making it difficult for Garen to find openings to engage. Furthermore, Garen lacks ranged attack options, making him susceptible to Jayce's harassment, and his low base stats in the early game put him in a particularly tough situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is effective to first seek help from the jungle to suppress Jayce's harassment. Building from Doran's Blade to Boots and Sunfire is also important to increase durability. Farming until there are fewer minions and positioning to bait Jayce's counterattack can be effective as well. Rushing to buy Ninja Tabi and building items like Ghostblade or Randuin's in parallel can provide the durability needed to ignore Jayce's poke. Additionally, by baiting a knockback with E and then closing in with Q, you can create opportunities to force an all-in against Jayce.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Jayce's early game strength and long-range attack capabilities. Jayce's poke with his cannon form is powerful, making it easy for him to deal damage to Yone from a distance. In particular, Yone has low base stats in the early game, making it difficult for him to avoid Jayce's Q and acceleration gate, which leads to him taking damage easily. Additionally, by pushing the minions, Jayce makes it harder for Yone to trigger his E for an engage, limiting the timing for Yone to initiate attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play cautiously in the early game and position behind minions. Look for opportunities to engage when Jayce misses his Q or after he uses his acceleration gate, then dive in with E, spam Q, and disengage with EQ after using R to immobilize him. It is also crucial to prioritize health recovery and damage reduction through items and runes, and to avoid unnecessary engages. In the mid to late game, leveraging Yone's scaling and aiming for engages in team fights can provide opportunities for a comeback.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high burst damage and poke ability that Jayce possesses. Jayce excels at long-range attacks, and his poke with Q (Shock Blast) is particularly strong. Teemo is strong against opponents who rely on auto-attacks due to his blind effect, but Jayce is a skill fighter and is not affected by the blind, making it difficult for Teemo to neutralize his damage. Additionally, Jayce can switch to his melee form to quickly close the gap on Teemo and deal burst damage. Furthermore, Jayce is also strong against tank champions, giving him high influence in team fights, while Teemo often struggles in team fights due to his squishiness.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, placing side wards from the start to secure vision will help track Jayce's movements. Attack while hiding behind minions and maneuver to avoid Jayce's Q. Use E (Blind) to neutralize Jayce's attacks and look for the right timing to counterattack with auto-attacks. Additionally, placing mushrooms early will allow you to deal damage while securing an escape route when Jayce approaches. Regarding the build, it is important to choose AP-focused items and quickly prepare zoning equipment to enhance sustain. In team fights, spreading mushrooms in the frontline while targeting the backline can help avoid Jayce's burst damage.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has powerful poke from a distance, making it easy for him to deal damage to Aatrox with his cannon form Q and W. Aatrox needs to aim for close-range combos, so it's difficult to approach while avoiding Jayce's skills, especially in the early game when his base stats are low, making him susceptible to Jayce's attacks. Additionally, Jayce has short cooldowns on his skills, making it hard for Aatrox to find the right moment to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, Aatrox should leverage his strong healing ability after leveling up, dealing damage with Q while aiming for knock-ups with W. It’s also important to use bushes for ambushes and to maneuver around minions to avoid Jayce's skills. Furthermore, preparing items early to increase durability can be effective in withstanding Jayce's attacks."
    },
    "loses": {
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has abundant AoE damage and crowd control, allowing him to trade while dodging Jayce's ranged attacks with his E. Particularly, when Jayce approaches, using W to reduce damage while countering with Q makes it easier to create advantageous situations. Additionally, after level 6, using R to disrupt Jayce's formation and deal burst damage creates opportunities for a comeback.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, prioritize safety and minions, farming while avoiding Jayce's ranged attacks with E. In levels 1 to 3, focus on short trades, dealing damage while maintaining distance with the W→Q→E combo. Once you reach level 6, it's important to use R to engage and aim for a kill with a full combo (W→Q→E). Also, managing the wave properly and not pushing too hard is crucial, allowing you to farm near your allies and create roaming opportunities. For items, prioritize Seeker early on and build towards AP durability to better counter Jayce.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has high durability and self-healing capabilities, allowing him to withstand Jayce's long-range poke. Jayce is strong at harassing from a distance early on, but Dr. Mundo can farm with his Q while healing slightly, enabling him to push back the lane while enduring the damage. Additionally, Jayce lacks sustain, making him disadvantaged in prolonged fights, which highlights Dr. Mundo's endurance.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, avoid Jayce's Q and E while farming with brush and mini Q. Avoid unnecessary damage and progress the lane while enduring. From levels 3 to 6, since Jayce gains an advantage with poke, counterattack with a short dash right after landing his Q or when he has used his E. It is important to purchase Bramble Vest early to reduce Jayce's healing. After level 6, engage using your ultimate and Flash, healing with R when Jayce's mobility and sustain are down. In team fights, you can contribute to the team by being on the front line and soaking up HP.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia can leverage her characteristics as a melee diver to trade favorably in lane while avoiding Jayce's long-range poke. By using Irelia's Q to farm minions and dodging Jayce's attacks, she can minimize damage taken. Additionally, Irelia can utilize her E's blink ability to approach Jayce while evading his skills, allowing her to deal burst damage. Furthermore, after reaching level 6, she can engage aggressively with her R, aiming for an all-in after forcing Jayce to use his shield and gate.\n\nTo gain the advantage, at the beginning of the lane, it's important to use minions to secure Q resets and sidestep to avoid Jayce's Q+E. Avoid pushing too hard, trade safely while using minions to heal, and create angles for E in the bushes or sides. Once reaching level 6, look for the right moment to engage Jayce with the ultimate after his skills have been used, allowing for significant damage. Additionally, managing vision and being cautious of ambushes based on Jayce's gate while preparing equipment for a quick finish will be key to expanding the advantage.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank and excels in team fights and lane sustain. Ornn's skills have crowd control, and his R's knock-up is particularly powerful, making it easy to negate Jayce's attacks. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, which gives him high sustain in lane and allows him to often withstand Jayce's poke. Furthermore, Ornn also has damage output as an AP tank, enabling him to counter Jayce's burst damage, making it easier for him to gain an advantage in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Ornn to utilize close combat in lane, dealing damage with Q while avoiding Jayce's attacks with E. Additionally, after Jayce uses his skills, it is effective to look for openings to approach and use W's crowd control to deal damage. In team fights, using R to knock up enemies and coordinating with allies to eliminate Jayce is key to victory. Moreover, since Jayce tends to run out of mana after using his skills frequently, timing attacks during that moment can also be effective.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite has high durability and can demonstrate powerful engage capabilities, especially against AD champions. While Jayce has strong harassment in the early game, Malphite can mitigate damage by gaining a shield with his E and can trade favorably with his Q. Additionally, Malphite's R provides strong crowd control in team fights, allowing him to close the gap and attack quickly before taking Jayce's poke.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, you should absorb Jayce's harassment with E while positioning behind minions to minimize damage taken. Once you reach level 6, use your ultimate to initiate a surprise attack, avoiding Jayce's gateway while executing the R→Q→W combo. In trades, you can retreat after a short Q→AA from W, allowing you to maintain an advantage in prolonged skirmishes. For item selection, prioritize armor and focus on HP and regeneration to sustain in fights. When entering team fights from mid, it’s crucial to use your R to initiate as a frontline and actively ENGAGE before taking Jayce's poke.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf excels in close combat and has strong traits for short-term skirmishes. Jayce is good at poking from a distance, but Olaf can use minions to avoid that poke. Additionally, after applying a slow with Olaf's Q, he can close the gap with his E and engage in a fight, making it easier to negate Jayce's range. Furthermore, Olaf's R allows him to ignore crowd control, enabling him to attack without worrying about Jayce's knockback or stun.\n\nTo take advantage, first, hide behind minions in the early game to avoid Jayce's poke while aiming for slows with Q. It is effective to approach with E after Jayce uses his skills or when they are on cooldown and initiate a fight. Prioritizing sustain items to secure lifesteal will help create a state where you can fight continuously. When going for an all-in, doing so after forcing Jayce to use his skills will allow for a more favorable engagement. It is also important to maintain distance and ensure an escape route.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has a dash attached to all of his skills, allowing him to utilize his high mobility to approach while avoiding Jayce's ranged attacks. By enduring the poke from Jayce's cannon form and jumping into melee range, it becomes easier to negate his burst damage. Additionally, a chance to counterattack arises the moment Jayce misses an attack in his melee form.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early lane phase, be aware of Jayce's hammer/cannon range and use W to shield against his ranged attacks. Farm while using minions to block angles, charge up with your passive, and clear minions with Q. The moment Jayce misses his Q in melee form is your opportunity to attack.\n\nAs you enter the mid-game, use E's slow and passive dash to approach when Jayce's spells and shield are down, bait him into hitting you with W, and then initiate your attack. Use R to chase or prevent escapes, and by dragging the fight into a prolonged engagement, you can maintain an advantage. It's crucial to manage your health carefully and be wary of jungle support with side wards while fighting.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has countermeasures against Jayce's ranged attacks and snares. In particular, Yasuo's W (Wind Wall) can block Jayce's Q (Hammer/Canon) and Gate, effectively nullifying Jayce's harassment. Additionally, after reaching level 6, Yasuo can use E (Sweeping Blade) to close the distance, making it easier to aim for combos with Q (Steel Tempest).\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, use Q behind the minions and prioritize CS. It is important not to engage recklessly and to avoid Jayce's attacks. As you level up, use E to approach Jayce and aim for Q combos. Especially, it is crucial to effectively use Wind Wall to block Jayce's attacks while looking for counterattack opportunities. As for items, incorporating Phantom Dancer and lifesteal is effective for dealing sustained damage while enhancing survivability.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and crowd control skills, allowing him to withstand Jayce's ranged attacks. Jayce has strong poke in the early game, but Sion can use minions to dodge Jayce's Q and can increase his durability with the shield from W. Furthermore, after level 4, Sion can adopt a proxy strategy to create advantageous situations against Jayce.\n\nTo take advantage, first, hide in the bush at the start of the lane to safely manage minions while waiting for Jayce to push. Properly manage the minions and prioritize farming under the tower. After level 4, push the wave and then start proxying, keeping distance from minions when Jayce chases to avoid his attacks while looking for a chance to counterattack. Additionally, in terms of item build, choosing Eclipse followed by full tank or Frostfire allows for easier countering against Jayce by stacking HP and armor early. The timing to call for ganks is also important; when Jayce overextends, requesting a gank from the jungler can lead to further advantages.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is favored.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he scales infinitely in damage by stacking his Q as he levels up. Jayce has strong harassment from the beginning, but Nasus can prioritize CS by freezing the wave near the tower and saving his Q to look for stacking opportunities. Additionally, Nasus's W slow and attack speed reduction are effective in limiting Jayce's attacks. After level 6, he can use his R to engage and quickly attack Jayce, increasing his chances of winning in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo gain an advantage, it is important to maintain a freeze near the tower in the early game and prioritize CS to stack Q. If Jayce harasses, do not force yourself forward; instead, farm safely near the tower. Request a gank from your jungler, and when Jayce overextends, use W to apply the slow and deal damage with Q. After level 6, actively engage using R and aim for a burst against Jayce to create a favorable situation.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has resistance to Jayce's ranged attacks, especially by using W (Pool) to avoid Jayce's burst damage. Jayce has strong poke in the early game, but Bloodmire can maintain his CS while recovering health with Q (Bloodthirst), giving him high sustainability in lane. Additionally, after level 6, Bloodmire can use his ultimate (Bloodlust) to further increase his durability and deal powerful sustained damage in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, start with Flash and endure early attacks with a Doran's Shield or healing items. From levels 1 to 5, avoid unnecessary aggression, collect CS with Q while managing health, and position yourself carefully to avoid Jayce's skills. If you get hit by Jayce's skills, dodge with W and aim to heal. After level 6, use your ultimate to secure health, approach after Jayce has used important skills, and negate damage with W while following up with E→Q. In team fights, it’s important to absorb damage from the side with R instead of fighting in the frontline for a long time, while avoiding damage with W and dealing sustained damage."

      "イラオイ": "Illaoi is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen's mobility and W (Hallowed Mist) make it easy to avoid Illaoi's E (Test of Spirit) and tentacle attacks. Gwen can quickly move with her short Q (Dash) to evade Illaoi's attacks, making it difficult for Illaoi to deal effective damage even when she deploys her tentacles. Additionally, Gwen's R (Ultimate) burst damage poses a threat to Illaoi. Illaoi has low mobility and is susceptible to Gwen's attacks, which can lead to unfavorable situations, especially in team fights and skirmishes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to use minions or brushes to aim with E and predict Gwen's movements to deploy tentacles effectively. Additionally, maintaining distance while fighting is necessary to avoid Gwen's Q and W. Furthermore, prioritizing tank-oriented items (like Black Cleaver or Sterak's) to increase durability can help withstand Gwen's attacks. Finally, utilizing TP in side lanes and roaming to other lanes can effectively apply pressure on Gwen.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen can deal high burst damage at short to medium range, and this damage increases significantly after level 6. Gwen's skills have percentage damage and true damage, allowing her to effectively deal damage to the tanky Mundo. Additionally, Gwen can easily avoid enemy attacks while in her mist, giving her high survivability in team fights. Mundo has many skills that consume HP, and if used incorrectly, there is a risk of reducing his durability. Furthermore, Gwen's mobility often allows her to dodge Mundo's skills, making it easier for her to take control of the situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prepare anti-healing items (like Bramble Vest) early to reduce Gwen's damage. Also, in the early game, it is crucial not to overextend and to manage minions while gaining experience and leveling up. Utilizing minions to maneuver and avoid Gwen's skill shots can also be effective. After level 6, using R to endure while looking for a counterattack opportunity can help bring the fight into a longer engagement. Additionally, summoners should prioritize TP and apply pressure from the side to create favorable situations against Gwen.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has high mobility and can easily dodge Sion's skills. In particular, Gwen's W has a long cooldown, which gives Sion a chance to attack when that timing is right, but due to the nature of Gwen's skills, she can avoid Sion's Q and R, making it difficult for him to deal damage. Additionally, Gwen has percentage damage and true damage, allowing her to bypass Sion's high durability and deal damage, especially when she opts for a tank build, making it challenging for Sion to effectively fight against her.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to build Grievous Wounds or Bramble Vest early to suppress Gwen's healing from her auto-attacks. Also, playing aggressively and preventing Gwen from touching the minion wave can help limit her scaling. Furthermore, strengthening team coordination and taking down Gwen early can lead to an advantageous position in late-game team fights.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen is strong in prolonged fights and has percentage damage and true damage, allowing her to effectively deal damage to the tanky Shen. Additionally, Gwen's E allows for easy blinking and her W creates a defensive zone, making it easier to avoid Shen's taunt and reducing the effectiveness of Shen's crowd control. Furthermore, Gwen has high survivability in team fights, making it difficult to counter her sustained damage even with Shen's R support.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to control the lane early on to avoid Gwen's attacks while aiming for short bursts with Q and auto-attacks. Also, considering the effect of Gwen's W, it is necessary to time the taunt with E without forcing an engagement. After level 6, supporting allies with R while being cautious of Gwen's roams and being aware of potential interventions in side lanes can help turn the situation in your favor. Additionally, building defensive items early can effectively reduce Gwen's damage and increase durability.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has high mobility and the ability to dodge skills, making it particularly easy for her to avoid Mordekaiser's attacks in close combat. Gwen's Q deals high damage, and her E's slow effect can restrict Mordekaiser's movement. Additionally, being in the mist allows Gwen to evade attacks more easily, giving her high survivability in team fights. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and with a long cooldown on his E, it becomes difficult to land attacks against the highly mobile Gwen.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important not to force fights and to farm safely while avoiding Gwen's skills. Especially at levels 1-2, avoid getting close to minions, and when poking, use Q and EQ combos to maintain distance. Also, having Ignite can apply pressure on Gwen. Furthermore, it is crucial to disrupt Gwen's farming to prevent her from getting strong, allowing Mordekaiser to leverage his power with strong damage after acquiring two items.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has strong damage from level 1, especially with her E + Q combo, which can deal high burst damage. Gangplank cannot counter Gwen at level 1, and attempting an early ambush is risky. Additionally, Gwen can avoid Gangplank's kegs with her W, making normal trades difficult. Furthermore, Gwen has a high attack speed, often outpacing Gangplank's kegs, which allows her to gain an advantage in early poke and farming.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to endure until level 3 and aim to outplay Gwen in the extended game. Also, rushing to buy Sheen and aiming for Executioner's Calling can increase damage against Gwen. Timing your poke after Gwen uses her mist and retreating when she dashes in can help you find opportunities to win trades. If you have Ignite, you can especially gain an advantage. Focusing on farming and enduring until you can land good critical hits is crucial.",
      "ナー": "Nar is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has powerful percentage damage against tanks and particularly high survivability in team fights. Gwen's mobility from her E and her ability to avoid attacks in the mist are very effective at dodging Nar's attacks. Additionally, Nar has low base stats in mini form and is weak to all-ins, making him susceptible to Gwen's attacks. Furthermore, managing Nar's transformations is difficult, and if he miscalculates the timing to enter Mega Nar, he can end up in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, from levels 1 to 3, it is crucial to harass and avoid Gwen's attacks. Focus on farming while maintaining distance and building up the transformation gauge. After level 6, look for opportunities to use your ultimate to pin Gwen against a wall, and in team fights, target the enemy backline after transforming. Additionally, prioritizing items that increase durability and provide magic resistance is important to reduce Gwen's damage.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has melee damage, healing, and mobility in the mid to late game, especially with high burst potential after level 6. Gwen can easily avoid enemy attacks while in her mist, demonstrating high survivability in team fights. Additionally, Gwen's skills deal percentage damage and true damage, allowing her to effectively damage Rumble, who has tank-like durability. Furthermore, Rumble struggles with heat management, and overheating results in silence, making him more susceptible to Gwen's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to use E to push the minions while harassing with Q to stabilize CS. Proper heat management and avoiding overheating can reduce risks. Additionally, it is crucial to save W to prevent Gwen's engage. After level 6, placing R in Gwen's approach path can help block her attacks and maintain distance during fights. In terms of item build, prioritizing AP and sustained damage while adjusting magic resistance as needed can enhance the ability to counter Gwen.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has high mobility and can maneuver advantageously against Yorick, who has a short range. Gwen's Q can deal damage at a short range, and using her W makes it easier to dodge Yorick's attacks. Additionally, Gwen's R can negate Yorick's Maiden and E's crowd control, enhancing her survivability in team fights and one-on-one situations. Furthermore, Gwen has percentage damage and true damage, allowing her to deal damage while ignoring Yorick's high durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively push from the early game and apply pressure on Gwen. Engaging in small trades using E and dragging the fight into a longer engagement can help gain an advantage. After level 6, it is crucial to utilize the Maiden and time the attempts to catch Gwen with crowd control. In terms of item selection, choosing a build that emphasizes attack speed and durability is effective in preparing to withstand Gwen's attacks. Additionally, using wards to secure vision and avoid ganks is important for maintaining lane safety.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has high sustained DPS and self-healing capabilities in close range, especially when she completes 2-3 items, allowing her to deal powerful damage. Cho'Gath is vulnerable to melee attacks and is easily hit by Gwen's Q and E in short trades. Additionally, if Gwen avoids Cho'Gath's Q with her W's shield and mist effect, it becomes difficult for Cho'Gath to deal damage. Furthermore, while Gwen is weak to sudden knock-ups, Cho'Gath's skills are slow to activate, which often allows Gwen to initiate the attack first.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to push the lane with E from the early game to disrupt Gwen's approach. By conserving Q and aiming for CC when Gwen gets close, you can limit her attacks. Also, purchasing Bramble early can help suppress Gwen's healing, increasing your durability in prolonged fights. Moreover, Cho'Gath needs to carefully time his R to go for kills while being cautious of Gwen's skills.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen is strong against melee opponents, particularly due to her Q's sustained damage and her W's mist for evasion, which are effective against Camille. Gwen can deal percentage damage to tanks, making it easier for her to survive Camille's burst damage. Additionally, Gwen's E slow effect limits Camille's mobility, making it difficult for her to position advantageously in close combat. Furthermore, Gwen has healing capabilities, which means that even if Camille initiates a short-term fight, Gwen can continue to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important for Camille to actively harass Gwen before reaching level 6 to chip away at her health. Camille should use her E to close the distance, deal damage with short combos, and manage minions effectively to avoid Gwen's Q. Additionally, Camille can look for a counterattack after Gwen uses her R, potentially provoking jungle intervention to apply pressure on Gwen. Furthermore, selecting the right items and increasing durability can also help Camille better withstand Gwen's damage.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has short-term burst damage and healing abilities, making it easier to chip away at Ornn's durability. In particular, Gwen's W provides healing and her ability to avoid attacks in the mist makes it difficult for Ornn to land his crowd control (CC), reducing the opportunities for Ornn to utilize his CC skills. Additionally, Gwen is highly mobile and can dodge Ornn's skills, making it challenging for Ornn to deal damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, prioritize surviving by using minions instead of forcing trades. Save E to avoid Gwen's attacks.\n2. Be cautious of Gwen's skills, especially her W's healing, and when trading, it's important to time your counterattacks carefully.\n3. In team fights, utilize your R to coordinate with allies and focus on applying CC to other enemy champions instead of targeting Gwen, thereby reducing her impact.\n4. Build items that emphasize durability, particularly those that increase magic resistance, to lessen Gwen's damage."

    "loses": {
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo can block Gwen's attacks with Wind Wall, especially by shutting down her Q and R, which significantly reduces her damage. Additionally, Yasuo has high mobility and can use his E to dodge Gwen's attacks while closing in to deal damage. Furthermore, by attacking after Gwen uses her E, he can avoid her counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, safely engage in trades while charging Q behind minions and look for opportunities to close the distance with E while blocking Gwen's attacks with Wind Wall. By engaging shortly after Gwen uses her E, he can reduce the risk of taking her counterattack while dealing damage. It's also important to manage the wave and fight in a position that is favorable to him. Avoid overcommitting and be mindful of ganks and Gwen's R to maintain the advantage.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage. The reasons why Warwick is favored against Gwen mainly lie in his crowd control abilities and healing. Warwick can suppress Gwen with his R (Infinite Dive), limiting her movement. Additionally, he can negate Gwen's W (Hallowed Mist), increasing his chances to deal damage while avoiding her attacks.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is crucial to avoid short trades with Gwen. Since Gwen has high burst damage, falling behind early can be detrimental. Warwick can use his W (Blood Hunt) to chase down low HP targets, mitigate damage with his E (Damage Reduction), and heal with his Q (Damage Recovery). By provoking Gwen's W or engaging simultaneously with allies to land his R, Warwick can create a favorable situation against Gwen.\n\nFurthermore, using Graves or Bloody items as a counter to healing is also important. This allows Warwick to suppress Gwen's healing while dealing sustained damage.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has powerful poke from a distance in the early game and can deal damage to Gwen through minions with his Q. Since Gwen has a short range, it is difficult for her to avoid Jayce's attacks, especially before level 6, making it hard for her to withstand his harassment. Additionally, Jayce has short cooldowns on his skills and can manage his distance easily, allowing him to chip away at Gwen's health before she can get close.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, use Q and W to poke Gwen from a distance, utilizing minions to safely deal damage. Before level 6, be mindful of Gwen's healing from her E and maneuver to prevent her from getting too close. After level 6, poke to reduce her health while her R is unavailable, and if Gwen engages, it’s important to either aim for a quick finish in hammer mode or escape using a blink or gate. This way, it becomes easier to maintain an advantageous situation against Gwen.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels in prolonged fights and has a strong ability to deal sustained damage. Gwen is good at short trades and can deal high damage by utilizing her safety within her W (Mist), but Singed can avoid her short-term burst by using proxy farming and roaming to leave the lane or disrupt the opponent's positioning. Additionally, Singed can use his slows and immobilization to limit Gwen's movements, maintaining an advantage in close combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be aware of Gwen's W in the early lane phase and to avoid close trades. Farming minions through proxying or taking a longer route is effective, and aiming to roam can influence other lanes. Building MR early increases durability against Gwen's magic damage, and in team fights, sticking to the backline and disrupting carries with fling can help turn the game in your favor.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven can aim for a quick finish in the early levels 2-3 and has high burst damage against Gwen. Riven can use her W, which has a stun, to limit Gwen's movements and deal damage with a short combo before retreating. Additionally, since attacks cannot be made from outside of Gwen's W (Hallowed Mist), Riven can engage while avoiding the effects of W.\n\nTo take advantage, Riven should use the combo Q→AA→Q→W (stun)→E in the early game to deal damage in short trades while utilizing her shield to survive. After level 6, she can either crush Gwen with instant burst damage using her R or engage after forcing Gwen to use her W, allowing for an even more advantageous fight. After Gwen uses her W, it becomes an opportunity for Riven to attack, so timing her engagement is key.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail gains range after level 6, allowing her to attack from a distance. This enables her to deal damage while avoiding Gwen's short-range attacks, especially when Gwen tries to close the gap, as she can use her E to maintain distance. Additionally, Kail's R grants her invulnerability, which can negate Gwen's ultimate and short-term combos, making her very powerful in team fights and one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to prioritize CS in the early game without overextending and to avoid Gwen's attacks. Once you reach level 6, you can use E to close in on Gwen, dealing damage with auto-attacks while limiting her movements. In the mid-game, as you get stronger at levels 11 and 16, focus on safely farming in the side lanes and dealing damage from a distance in team fights. Also, be aware of Gwen's R cooldown and engage at that timing to gain the upper hand.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora can showcase her strength in close combat against Gwen. By using Fiora's W (Riposte), she can parry Gwen's key skills, E and R, which allows her to negate Gwen's damage while counterattacking. Additionally, Fiora has powerful percentage damage against tanks, making her well-suited to whittle down Gwen's durability.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to aim for Gwen's vitals from behind the minions at the start of the lane and engage in short trades. Since you cannot attack within Gwen's W (Sanctuary), it is effective to force her to use it before initiating an attack. After level 6, use Fiora's R to secure healing and look for the right moment to parry Gwen's skills before going all-in. As for items, choosing Trinity Force and Sterak's Gage allows for a balance of damage and durability.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum can apply strong pressure from the early game and is a fighter that can easily aim for a quick resolution. In particular, Gwen is weak in the early game and needs to play defensively against Braum's attacks. By closing in with Braum's Q and delivering a short burst of damage, you can gain an advantage over Gwen. Additionally, Braum has a stun that immobilizes, making it easier to limit Gwen's movements and utilize this strength in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, approach with Q while pushing the minions and dominating the lane. Do not give Gwen a chance to use her skills to avoid attacks, and actively engage. Between levels 3 and 6, initiate a sustain battle, using skill cooldowns to attack with full force. In particular, using R to jump in allows you to secure a kill on Gwen, and it is important to dive towers without fear. Focusing on coordination with the jungle and building an early advantage before Gwen can grow is key to victory.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing capabilities against Gwen, making him good at lane maintenance. Gwen's main sources of damage are auto-attacks and skills, but Garen can silence her skill usage with his Q (Decisive Strike), allowing him to gain an advantage, especially in one-on-one combat. Additionally, Garen's R (Judgment) deals true damage, which can bypass Gwen's durability and inflict significant damage, making him a very tough opponent for her.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, Garen should actively trade in lane, silencing Gwen's skills with his Q, then dealing damage with W (Demolish) and providing sustained damage with E (Ground Slam). Furthermore, Garen can utilize his passive healing effect to continuously deal damage while taking hits from Gwen. By choosing Stridebreaker as his first item, he can close the gap to Gwen more easily and deal damage more effectively. This allows him to engage in favorable trades while still taking hits from Gwen.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia possesses short-term mobility and burst damage, allowing her to trade strongly against Gwen, especially from the early to mid-game. By using Irelia's E (stun) to disable Gwen, and then dealing damage with Q, she can suppress Gwen's sustain. Additionally, Irelia can target Gwen's W cooldown to deal damage without giving her a chance to retaliate.\n\nTo take advantage, first, manage the minions well in the early lane phase to secure Q resets. Look for the timing when Gwen's W is down, use E to aim for the stun, and then deal damage with Q. After level 6, be cautious of Gwen's R, and either attack from outside the range of her R or force her to use it before engaging, allowing for safer damage output. Furthermore, choosing items like Bramble Vest or Black Cleaver to aim for a quick finish is crucial to suppress Gwen's healing. In team fights, it is important to avoid overextending and look for the right moment to use R to split the enemy lines, ensuring that Gwen's strengths are minimized.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has a healing effect from his Q, which gives him high lane sustain. This allows him to continuously fight against Gwen's short trades. Additionally, Bloodmire's W has an invulnerability effect, making it easier to avoid Gwen's burst damage and enabling him to deal sustained damage in team fights. Furthermore, after level 6, Bloodmire can use his R to create a numbers advantage and play aggressively.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to start the lane by using Q to farm minions while maintaining healing and avoiding unnecessary trades. Between levels 1 and 3, secure sustain with Q without taking damage from Gwen's attacks, and dodge her burst with W. After level 6, it is effective to participate in team fights using R and aim for a comeback. Additionally, by securing vision and preparing items, you can create a favorable situation against Gwen.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone can harass Gwen from a distance using his Q from the early game and can safely create distance with his E. Since being inside Gwen's W nullifies his attacks, it's important for Yone to engage from outside of her W. Additionally, after level 6, he can use his R to split Gwen and aim for a burst, allowing him to leverage his instant damage advantage.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, it's essential to harass with Q in small increments while avoiding Gwen's W. In the mid-game, manage distance using E while continuously chipping away with Q from outside her W. Once you reach level 6, you can use R to split Gwen and ambush her for a significant advantage. Ambushing from bushes or the side is also effective. To avoid prolonged battles, it's important to quickly gather lifesteal and defensive items.",
      "セト": "Sett has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett has a high ability to deal sustained damage against Gwen, especially excelling in long trades. By utilizing Sett's passive for HP recovery and the shield from his W, he can return damage while taking hits from Gwen. Additionally, Sett's E provides catch potential, preventing Gwen from escaping and making it easier to force trades. Furthermore, Gwen's skills often have low accuracy, allowing Sett to leverage his strength in close combat to gain an advantage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively bully Gwen from the early game. Reducing her HP before reaching level 6 secures lane dominance. After forcing Gwen to use her E, hitting her with W can mitigate her damage while allowing for a counterattack. In team fights, it is desirable to use Sett's R to catch Gwen and increase his impact in team battles. For item builds, choosing Stridebreaker or Goredrinker and incorporating shield items can reduce Gwen's damage and allow for sustained fighting.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has range and can deal damage to Gwen with his E while chasing with his Q. Although Gwen has strong melee burst, it becomes difficult for her to retaliate if caught by Urgot's E. Additionally, Urgot has high base stats and percentage damage, allowing him to deal consistent damage to Gwen. Furthermore, Urgot's crowd control (stuns and pulls) makes it easier to limit Gwen's movements, giving him an advantage in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to play cautiously in the early game, accurately landing E and gaining a lead with Q. Apply pressure behind minions and utilize sustain without forcing engagements. Once you reach level 6, you can use R to restrain Gwen and decide whether to finish her off or escape, maximizing Urgot's strengths. Also, managing minions effectively and applying tower pressure can create favorable situations against Gwen. In team fights, it is crucial to engage at the front line and prevent Gwen from flanking from the side. Being mindful of cooldown management is key, as the presence of E and R can significantly change the outcome, so timing is essential for victory.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas has superiority in sustain and range. Gragas's Q, \"Barrel,\" allows him to harass Gwen from a distance, especially in the early game, reducing the risk of taking damage from Gwen while dealing damage himself. Additionally, the healing effect from Gragas's W is very effective in sustained trades, making it easier to maintain health. Furthermore, Gragas's E can be used for positioning and dodging, allowing him to avoid Gwen's E engage and increasing his chances for counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, Gragas should harass with Q between levels 1 and 2 to limit Gwen's movements. After level 3, it is important to time dodging Gwen's E+Q combo with his E while counterattacking. Gragas can push the minions and roam, and at level 6, he can use his R to knock Gwen back, isolating her and dealing burst damage. In team fights, Gragas can disrupt the enemy formation while Gwen can deal sustained damage up close, making positioning a key factor in determining the outcome.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is an AA (auto-attack) reliant champion, and he can utilize this trait against Gwen. While Gwen has strong percentage damage against tanks, Jax has skills that enhance his AA, making him particularly strong against AA-focused opponents. Additionally, Jax's E ability can negate attacks, reducing the damage from Gwen's Q, which can be advantageous in trades.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to avoid the center of Gwen's Q. If you get hit by the center, you will take true damage, so caution is necessary. From levels 1 to 5, you won't lose significantly to Gwen, so playing carefully while using E to negate Gwen's attacks and looking for counter opportunities is effective. Also, by considering Gwen's cooldowns and timing your E usage, you can gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, having healing reduction items can also be effective in suppressing Gwen's healing.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, as his damage scales infinitely by stacking his Q. Gwen has strong burst damage from early to mid-game, but while Nasus is weak in the early game, he becomes strong in the late game by farming well and stacking his Q. Additionally, Nasus's W (Wither) can hinder Gwen's attacks and limit her mobility with its slow effect. This makes it difficult for Gwen to approach Nasus, allowing him to play advantageously.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, safely stack Q under the tower while avoiding Gwen's attacks. Save W and use it when Gwen attacks to disrupt her and create a chance for a counterattack. Also, coordinate with the jungle to gank Gwen, allowing for an early advantage. Once the late game arrives, a sufficiently stacked Nasus can apply pressure with split pushing, maneuvering in a way that disrupts Gwen during team fights to aim for victory.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon excels in early short-term burst damage, especially with powerful all-ins at levels 2 and 3. Gwen is weak against early ganks and strong short-term peaks, and by combining Pantheon's Q and E, he can deal instant damage and aim for a stun. Additionally, Pantheon has a global R, making it easier to apply pressure on other lanes and influence the game as a whole.\n\nTo take advantage, start by farming CS from level 1, then use E at level 2 to approach Gwen and deal damage with Q. Before Gwen can retaliate, disengage with E and attack again with Q, allowing for sustained damage while staying safe. After level 6, it's important to use R to roam to other lanes and push the game in your favor. In team fights, Pantheon is good at targeting the backline, but since Gwen deals sustained damage from the frontline, avoiding prolonged fights is key.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous excels in prolonged battles and has high damage from critical hits. Particularly, with Tremendous's R (Undying Rage), he cannot die for 5 seconds, allowing him to withstand Gwen's high damage output. Additionally, Tremendous can easily close the gap with his E (Spinning Slash) and avoid Gwen's W (Hallowed Mist), making it easier to create opportunities for attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to first check the cooldown of Gwen's W and initiate attacks during that time. After Gwen uses W, Tremendous can engage in a fight while healing with his Q (Cleave), leveraging item differences in long trades. Furthermore, pushing the lane and executing a split push while Gwen is absent can be effective in gaining control of the sides. Additionally, being mindful of jungle interventions and securing vision can create advantageous situations."

      "ケネン": "Kennen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he becomes extremely powerful in the late game as he accumulates farm. As Nasus's Q stacks progress, his damage output increases, and with a tank build, he has high durability, making it difficult for Kennen to effectively deal damage in team fights. Additionally, Nasus's W (Wither) restricts Kennen's movement and takes away his advantage in close combat, making it harder for Kennen to showcase his strengths.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively harass from the early game and disrupt Nasus's Q stacking. Creating as much of a lead as possible before level 6 and aiming for kills before Nasus can grow is effective. Furthermore, in terms of item selection, acquiring Nashor's Tooth early and aiming for Riftmaker or Zhonya's can increase survival rates in team fights. Additionally, securing vision and ensuring that Nasus does not have an easy time farming is also crucial.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus is very weak in the early game, but he can deal powerful damage in the late game by stacking his Q, and he also has tanky durability. While Yasuo has high mobility and can deal short-term damage, if he allows Nasus to stack his Q, it becomes difficult to counter him in the late game. Additionally, Nasus's E slows and reduces attack speed, which increases Yasuo's reliance on auto-attacks, causing him to lose his advantage in close combat. Furthermore, Nasus has high lane sustain, so even if Yasuo applies pressure, Nasus can easily continue to farm.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to apply pressure on Nasus from the early game to prevent him from stacking his Q. By using E to poke while managing minions, you can reduce Nasus's opportunities to farm his Q. Also, saving Wind Wall to block Nasus's E and jungle skills can help you gain an advantage in close combat. When you reach level 6, coordinating a knock-up and attacking all at once can also be effective for securing early kills. Avoiding prolonged fights and focusing on utilizing knock-ups in team fights will be key to alleviating Yasuo's disadvantage.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus prioritizes farming in the early game and, by stacking his Q, becomes a powerful force in the late game. Riven needs to play aggressively in the early game, but Nasus's W (Wither) slows her down and reduces her attack speed, making it difficult for Riven to burst down Nasus. Additionally, Nasus has high sustain, which can make Riven's short trades ineffective. Furthermore, Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, and if Riven is not well-farmed, her impact in team fights diminishes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Riven to apply pressure on Nasus from the early game and prevent him from stacking his Q. By utilizing Riven's combos for short trades and trying to bait out Nasus's W before going for a full combo, she can deal damage while escaping. It is also crucial to place wards effectively to avoid ganks and ensure that Nasus does not have an easy time farming. In the mid-game, Riven can roam to increase her influence in other lanes, which is an effective strategy to suppress Nasus's growth.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he can stack his Q by farming, becoming very powerful in the late game. Fiora has short-term damage potential, but with Nasus's W reducing her attack speed and applying a slow effect, Fiora, who relies on auto-attacks, finds it difficult to deal damage. Additionally, Nasus has high durability and can withstand Fiora's attacks, making long trades unfavorable for her. Furthermore, if Nasus uses his Wither on Fiora, she could quickly find herself at a disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively harass Nasus in the early game to prevent him from stacking his Q, and to save W (Riposte) to parry Nasus's W, allowing Fiora to gain an advantage. It is also crucial not to push the lane too hard, use wards to secure vision, and avoid creating situations where Nasus can farm easily. In the mid-game, once Nasus starts stacking his Q, it is necessary to avoid long trades and repeatedly engage in short bursts of damage to suppress Nasus's growth.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he gains powerful abilities after level 6, especially as he stacks his Q, which allows his damage to scale infinitely. Nasus's E (Spirit Fire) slows and reduces attack speed, limiting Renekton's attacks and causing him to lose his advantage in one-on-one situations. Additionally, Nasus excels at farming under towers, and if Renekton pushes him under the tower, he may become unable to do anything. Furthermore, Nasus's passive provides high sustain, allowing him to absorb Renekton's trades, making him disadvantaged in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively seek ganks from the early game. Before Nasus can grow, coordinating with the jungler to apply early pressure and disrupt his farming will prevent him from stacking. Additionally, before Nasus reaches level 6, initiating trades to manage Fury and deal short-term damage can be effective. If forced to farm under the tower, focusing on CS and avoiding unnecessary trades can help suppress Nasus's growth.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, especially as he stacks his Q, allowing his damage to scale infinitely. In the early stages, Yorick can manage minions and disrupt Nasus's Q stacking, but once Nasus reaches level 6 and gets his items, his strength becomes apparent. Additionally, Nasus's E slow and attack speed reduction can limit Yorick's attacks, potentially putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Nasus can deal high damage even with a tank build, making it difficult for Yorick to counter him when he relies on his pets.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, it is important to push the minions to prevent Nasus from stacking his Q in the early game. Engaging in short trades using Ghost and quickly disengaging after being hit by Nasus's E or slow is necessary. Additionally, creating an advantage before Nasus reaches level 6 and using roams and vision to support other lanes can be effective. As for items, building Bramble Vest or armor early can help reduce Nasus's damage, and in team fights, it is crucial to focus on Yorick's initiation and managing his pets. Avoid unnecessary face-to-face fights and aim to create advantages in short bursts.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he becomes extremely powerful after level 6. Once Nasus stacks his Q, his damage scales infinitely, allowing him to deal high damage even with a tank build. Additionally, Nasus's W slows and reduces attack speed, limiting Irelia's attacks and taking away her advantage in close combat. Furthermore, Nasus has high lane sustain, making it difficult for Irelia to gain an advantage even if she tries to freeze the minions, as Nasus can continue to farm.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Early Pressure**: It is important to actively attack and chip away at Nasus's HP before he reaches level 6. Starting to trade from level 2 and using minions to your advantage is a good strategy.\n\n2. **Minion Wave Management**: Freeze the minions to prevent Nasus from approaching and deny him CS. This can hinder his ability to stack.\n\n3. **Utilizing Ganks**: Coordinate with the jungler to look for opportunities to dive Nasus and establish an early advantage. Applying pressure before Nasus can grow will help suppress his strength in the late game.\n\n4. **Item Selection**: Choosing Executioner's Calling can help reduce Nasus's healing. It is important to avoid Bramble Vest and select items that can counter Nasus.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Irelia's disadvantage and counter Nasus.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus has a strong farming ability against the very weak Bloodmire in the early game. Nasus can use his Q to last-hit minions and stack up to gain powerful damage in the late game. Bloodmire has a long cooldown in the early game and low DPS, making it difficult to take control against Nasus. Additionally, Nasus's W (Wither) slows and reduces attack speed, limiting Bloodmire's attacks and making it hard to approach. Furthermore, Nasus can choose a tank build to increase his durability, making it easier for him to survive in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, it is important to keep pushing the lane to prevent Nasus from stacking his Q in the early game and to force the minions under the tower. This reduces Nasus's opportunities to farm. If you have Ignite, actively harassing Nasus and looking for kill opportunities can be effective. Additionally, when hit by Nasus's W, it is crucial to use your own W (Pool) to avoid damage and secure an escape route. In the mid-game and beyond, actively roaming before Nasus gets strong and applying pressure in other lanes can help suppress Nasus's growth.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus can stack his Q from the early game, becoming a powerful damage dealer in the late game. Rumble excels at harassing from a distance, but when Nasus approaches to farm his Q, he can be slowed by Wither, making him vulnerable to counterattacks. Additionally, by opting for a tank build, Nasus increases his durability, making it easier for him to survive in team fights. Furthermore, Nasus is extremely strong in the late game, and if Rumble hasn't scaled well, his impact in team fights diminishes.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. From the start, it is crucial to use Flame Spitter (Q) and Polling (E) to continuously disrupt Nasus's Q stacking. By pushing the minions, you can make it harder for Nasus to farm his Q.\n2. When Nasus approaches, applying a slow with W and then following up with E to engage in short trades can effectively deal damage.\n3. After level 6, using the sub-jungle and teleport to ambush from the side can effectively pressure Nasus. In team fights, consider using your ultimate to zone and restrict Nasus's movements.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus prioritizes farming in the early game and gains stacks with his Q, making him a champion with powerful damage in the late game. Teemo excels at harassing from a distance, but he has limitations in countering Nasus's durability and scaling. Additionally, Nasus's E (Wither) slows Teemo and reduces his attack speed, which neutralizes Teemo's auto-attacks and causes him to lose his advantage in trades. Furthermore, after level 6, Nasus has more opportunities to catch Teemo with his E, increasing the risk of being turned around.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Teemo to freeze the lane closer to his tower from the early game to prevent Nasus from stacking his Q while continuing to harass. Also, using wards and mushrooms to secure vision and limit Nasus's movements can disrupt his farming. After level 6, it is effective to avoid direct confrontations and continue poking from a distance with E. Additionally, choosing Mercury's Treads or Hextech Boots can enhance Teemo's ability to escape from Nasus's E, and it is advisable to prepare items before engaging in team fights.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus focuses on farming in the early game and becomes very powerful in the late game by stacking his Q. Mundo needs to apply pressure on Nasus early, but if Nasus can safely stack his Q, his strength in the later stages of the game becomes prominent. Additionally, Nasus's W (Wither) restricts Mundo's movement and reduces his attack speed, which diminishes Mundo's damage output. Furthermore, as Nasus grows, Mundo's healing ability may become less effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively pressure Nasus from the early game and disrupt his Q stacks with Q (Bone Cracker). Using W (Infection) to reduce incoming damage while managing minions can also delay Nasus's growth. After level 6, it is effective to take risky trades using R (Sadism) and time attacks based on Nasus's W usage. Additionally, considering items like Grievous Wounds or Bramble Vest to suppress Nasus's healing should also be taken into account.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Nasus is weak in the early game, he becomes extremely powerful in the late game as he stacks his Q. Gragas can harass effectively in the early game, but if Nasus can safely stack his Q, his strength in late-game team fights and duels becomes prominent. Additionally, Nasus's Wither slows and reduces attack speed, limiting Gragas's ability to deal effective damage in team fights. Furthermore, Gragas's skills have a slow activation time, making it difficult to interrupt Nasus's Q stacks, which can lead to Gragas suffering as Nasus grows stronger.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively harass from the early game to prevent Nasus from stacking his Q. Gragas should use his E to maintain distance while managing minions with barrels to disrupt Nasus's farming. Strengthening coordination with the jungler to apply early pressure on Nasus can also help curb his growth. Additionally, after level 6, using R to push Nasus back and fulfill his role in team fights is crucial.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus focuses on farming in the early game and becomes very powerful in the late game by stacking his Q. Nasus gains high sustain by using \"Kleptomancy\" and \"Doran's Shield,\" making Olaf's poke less effective. Additionally, Nasus's Wither slows and reduces attack speed, limiting Olaf's attacks and taking away his advantage in trades. Furthermore, Nasus grows into a strong tank after level 6, and if Olaf is not well-farmed, he may struggle in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is advisable to start with \"Ignite\" and play aggressively to pressure Nasus. It is important to go for all-ins between levels 1-6 to dominate the lane and disrupt Nasus's farming. Also, after putting 2 points into Q, maximizing E and purchasing Ninja Tabi will allow Olaf to fight more favorably against Nasus. After securing a kill, pushing the wave and freezing the lane to hinder Nasus can also be effective.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus can easily farm minions from the early game and scales quickly. Nasus can infinitely increase his damage by stacking with his Q, making him very powerful in the late game. Additionally, Nasus's E slows and reduces attack speed, limiting Sett's ability to trade and making it difficult for him to engage. Furthermore, Nasus excels at sustaining in lane due to his passive lifesteal, making it hard for Sett to deal damage. Before level 6, it is difficult for Sett to punish Nasus, and after level 6, Nasus becomes stronger, making Sett more likely to be overwhelmed.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following strategies can be considered:\n1. Hide in the bush near Nasus's tower when the first wave meets, and all-in him from behind when he goes for the minions.\n2. When Nasus returns, disrupt his farm by pulling him out of experience and minion range.\n3. After Nasus uses his E, freeze the wave to play safely and prevent him from stacking.\n4. Since Sett has TP, he can roam to mid or jungle to gain gold, creating a more favorable situation than Nasus.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, Sett can alleviate his disadvantage against Nasus and maintain pressure in lane."

      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high harassment ability from the early game and can prevent Nasus from stacking his Q. It is important to use Quinn's ranged attacks and skills to deny Nasus CS and delay his farm. Additionally, Quinn has high mobility, allowing her to attack while avoiding Nasus's slows, giving her an edge in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, actively harass Nasus in the early lane phase (1-6) by dealing damage with Q and auto-attacks while pushing to deny him CS. Use wards to keep an eye on the enemy jungle, ensuring that Nasus cannot farm safely. After level 6, since Nasus's ultimate becomes powerful, avoid unnecessary all-ins and maintain distance while coordinating with teammates to attack with burst damage. Additionally, roam to influence other lanes, securing an advantage across the map. As for items, prepare an early healing reduction item (Executioner's Calling) and focus on mobility boots and core items to further increase pressure on Nasus.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus is very weak in the early game and needs to prioritize farming. Illaoi can apply pressure on Nasus with her E and can deal short-term damage using her tentacles. Additionally, by avoiding or disrupting Nasus's Q, she can stop his stacking, which delays his growth.\n\nTo take advantage, you should start attacking Nasus with E between levels 1 and 5 while managing the minions. When Nasus is farming with his Q, it's important to deal damage using tentacles while maintaining distance. Once you reach level 6, use E followed by R to attack with full force, keeping an eye on Nasus's Wither and maintaining distance to create an even more advantageous situation. In the mid-game and beyond, leverage the strength of your tentacles in team fights and aim to end the game before Nasus can fully grow.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high burst damage against Nasus and excels in short trades. Nasus is very weak in the early game, and if he cannot farm smoothly, he will struggle in the mid to late game. Camille's mobility with her E (Flash) allows her to avoid Nasus's slows while dealing damage. Additionally, while Nasus's E (Wither) is powerful, Camille can avoid it by positioning behind minions.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to establish priority at level 1. By applying pressure to force Nasus to retreat before he reaches level 2, Camille can disrupt his farming. After Nasus uses his E, there will be an opportunity for Camille to retaliate with her Q (Blade Dance). Furthermore, after Camille acquires Divine Sunderer, it is crucial to avoid 1v1 fights without using her R (Ultimate), prioritize CS while dodging Nasus's skills, and increase her gold income. If Nasus returns with TP, Camille can trade with her remaining mana and aim for a kill before level 6.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has powerful CC skills against Nasus, which can particularly limit his movements when he uses Q to stack. Additionally, K'Sante deals high damage in an all-out state, improving his one-on-one performance, making it easier to engage in favorable trades before Nasus can grow strong. Furthermore, by freezing the lane, you can take advantage of Nasus's early weakness and prevent him from stacking.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to first push the initial 2-3 waves and then freeze the lane, aggressively using Grasp when Nasus goes for the minions. By aiming for trades after Nasus uses Q, you can hinder his healing. Also, if Nasus goes for an all-in, you can create a chance to counterattack by using E on the minions. Be mindful of the level difference; while there is a chance to win at level 6, Nasus becomes stronger at level 11, so it's crucial to secure the advantage early.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion can apply pressure on Nasus in the early game and maneuver to prevent Nasus from stacking his Q. Sion's Q allows for long-range attacks, which can disrupt Nasus while he is farming minions, making it crucial to delay Nasus's growth. Additionally, Sion has high durability and excels at engaging in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, deal damage to Nasus with Q while pushing the minions to prevent him from stacking his Q. In short trades, use the E→Q→AA combo to deal instant damage, then prepare to absorb damage with W. By pushing the minion wave towards the enemy tower, you can prevent Nasus from safely stacking his Q. Once you reach level 6, use R to roam and influence other lanes or the dragon, allowing you to gain an overall advantage in the match.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox deals high damage to Nasus and can use wide-range hard crowd control, making it easier to limit Nasus's movements. Nasus is very weak in the early game, and if he cannot farm smoothly, he will struggle in the mid to late game. However, Aatrox can apply pressure on Nasus by actively trading before level 6. Additionally, Aatrox's passive healing effect allows him to sustain fights even when taking damage from Nasus.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to manage the wave first and attack when Nasus is trying to last-hit minions. By attacking Nasus before level 6 and aiming for a tower dive, you can establish an early lead. After level 6, it is effective to bait Nasus's ultimate and act aggressively at the right timing. Also, by asking the jungler for a gank, you can apply pressure before Nasus stacks up, creating an even more advantageous situation.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has strong damage against Nasus from the early game, and especially at level 6, he can use his ultimate skill, R, to quickly take down Nasus. Garen's Q provides silence, which can cancel Nasus's W and reduce his attack speed, thereby limiting Nasus's damage output. Additionally, Garen has high durability and excels at lane sustain due to his passive healing effect.\n\nTo take advantage, Garen should actively harass Nasus in the early stages of the lane, managing the minion wave to disrupt Nasus's farming. Specifically, clearing minions quickly to prevent Nasus from stacking his Q is effective, as it keeps him from getting close. Once at level 6, look for opportunities to kill Nasus with R, and consider coordinating with the jungler to eliminate him if they intervene. Furthermore, attacking when Nasus does not have his ultimate can create a favorable situation against him.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen is strong in early short trades and can disrupt Nasus's farming. Shen's W can negate Nasus's Q auto-attacks, making it easier to prevent Nasus from stacking his Q. Additionally, Shen can taunt Nasus with his E, limiting his ability to attack. Furthermore, Shen's R provides an infinite range shield, allowing him to support allies while also applying pressure on Nasus.\n\nTo take advantage, Shen should push the minions from level 1 to level 5 to prevent Nasus from touching his Q. He should conserve his W to negate Nasus's attacks while using E to taunt Nasus and deal damage. After level 6, he can use his R to roam and help allies, increasing overall pressure. In the mid-game, it is important to use E taunt to lock down carries and secure an advantage in team fights before Nasus can scale. If hit by Nasus's Wither, remember to retreat briefly and look for opportunities to counterattack with W.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Mordekaiser has strong long-trade capabilities against Nasus, particularly exploiting Nasus's early weakness. With Mordekaiser's passive providing sustained damage and his E ability for closing the gap, he can apply pressure on Nasus. Additionally, by using Mordekaiser's R, he can trap Nasus in the afterlife, forcing a 1v1 situation, and if victorious, he can steal Nasus's stats.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to actively bully Nasus during the first four waves. Before Nasus can farm, slow push the wave and maintain a freeze to prevent him from stacking. Once you reach level 6, use E to close in and create an opportunity to all-in with R to take down Nasus. If Nasus purchases QSS, it is important to continue maintaining the freeze and push the wave with the help of the jungler. Buying Bramble Vest first can also be effective in suppressing Nasus's healing.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius has high burst damage in the early game and can actively trade against Nasus, especially between levels 1 and 5. After pulling Nasus with Darius's E, he can land his Q and follow up with an auto-attack to stack his passive and deal sustained damage. Additionally, Nasus is very weak in the early game, making it difficult for him to farm when taking Darius's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to save E at the start and hit Nasus with Q in short trades to stack the passive. From level 2, use the E→Q→AA combo for short skirmishes, forcing Nasus to use his Q and preventing him from stacking. Push the lane to secure tower plates and induce recalls, creating an even more advantageous situation. After level 6, look for opportunities to use R to secure kills, and if Nasus is stacking well, roaming or taking side lanes can influence the entire game.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax has a powerful attack speed buff against champions that are highly reliant on auto-attacks (AA), and he can deal high DPS even against opponents like Nasus, who have slows and attack speed reductions, by utilizing his self-enhancement skills. Additionally, Nasus is very weak in the early game, and if he cannot farm smoothly, he will struggle in the mid to late game, allowing Jax to apply pressure early and gain an advantage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively harass Nasus from the early game and disrupt his minion CS. Specifically, attacking him when he is last-hitting minions with his Q can steal experience and delay his growth. Managing the wave is also key; be careful not to break your own wave before Nasus creates a large wave, as this will help disrupt his CS.\n\nAfter level 6, Nasus becomes powerful, so it is recommended to acquire Sheen early and utilize Phase Rush or Swift Boots to enhance mobility. Team play is also important; coordinating before Nasus grows and avoiding one-on-one fights can help create advantageous situations while leveraging Jax's strengths.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high pushing power from the early game and can disrupt Nasus's Q stacking. Nasus is very weak in the early game, and if he cannot farm smoothly, he will struggle in the mid to late game. Yone can use his E to dodge Nasus's W while dealing damage to him with short bursts, making it easier to gain an advantage in one-on-one situations. Additionally, Yone's skills do not consume mana and have short cooldowns, allowing for sustained aggression.\n\nTo take advantage, first, actively push the lane early on to disrupt Nasus's minion farming. This makes it difficult for Nasus to stack his Q. Next, aim for a timing when Nasus's W is on cooldown to create distance with E and go for short bursts. After level 6, utilize R to deal instant damage and increase the chances of taking down Nasus. Additionally, roaming to contribute to other lanes can help shift the overall flow of the game in your favor. It is crucial to keep applying pressure before Nasus can grow strong.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has strong laning capabilities from the early game and can apply pressure on Nasus, especially between levels 1 and 3. The combo of pulling Nasus with Urgot's E, then delaying the attack with W, and dealing damage with Q is very effective. Additionally, Urgot excels in short skirmishes and can potentially take down Nasus before he stacks his Q.\n\nTo take advantage, you should actively harass Nasus in the early game and push the minions to disrupt his farming. Especially between levels 1-3, Urgot's skills are powerful, so it's important to deal damage after hitting E with W and Q to chip away at Nasus's HP. Also, using TP to roam and influence other lanes can effectively secure overall map control.\n\nAfter level 6, if you catch Nasus with Urgot's R, you can definitely aim for a kill, so timing your engages aggressively is key to achieving victory."

    "beats": {
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's ranged attacks and barrel placements are very troublesome. Gangplank excels at harassing in lane, using barrels to deal damage to Fiora while preventing her from closing the gap. Additionally, Fiora is a melee champion, making it difficult for her to approach Gangplank's skill range, which makes her susceptible to harassment. Furthermore, Fiora's crowd control is limited to her W, making it hard to negate Gangplank's barrels, thus reducing her ability to respond to ganks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early lane phase, try to hide behind minions to avoid the explosions of Gangplank's barrels and use Q for short trades to target vitals effectively. It is also crucial to utilize W (Parry) to negate Gangplank's Q and barrel explosions to minimize damage. After level 6, use R to target isolated enemies, and in team fights, focus on entering from the side to rotate vitals and deal quick damage. Finally, always check the placement and range of barrels, as prolonged fights can lead to disadvantages, so it is necessary to close the distance or destroy barrels at the right timing.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at early harassment and can avoid Pantheon's attacks with barrel combos. In particular, Gangplank's skill range is long, making his harassment in the lane powerful. Pantheon is good at short-term burst damage, but when Gangplank's barrels are destroyed, the opportunities for Pantheon to attack decrease. Additionally, Gangplank can cleanse CC and heal with his W, allowing him to mitigate Pantheon's attacks. Furthermore, as team fights drag on, Gangplank's scaling becomes more effective, leading to a tendency for Pantheon to fall behind as the game progresses.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively go for all-ins against Gangplank from the early game and aim for early kills. Especially at level 2 or 3, using Q + E + W to aggressively engage can force Gangplank to be mindful of his barrels. It is also crucial to be aware of clearing barrels with minions and to position oneself to avoid entering the barrel range. Additionally, choosing a build that emphasizes early kills with Ignite can increase Pantheon's kill pressure. Finally, pushing the lane to roam and creating numerical advantages in other lanes can help shift the overall flow of the game in Pantheon's favor.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's long-range poke and harassment with barrels are extremely powerful. Gangplank can deal damage from a distance with his Q while using barrels to prevent Singed from approaching. Since Singed cannot deal damage without getting close, it becomes difficult to avoid Gangplank's barrels and skills, especially in the early game, leading to struggles with harassment. Additionally, Gangplank's R (Cannon Barrage) has infinite range, making it easy for him to assist other lanes, which makes it hard for Singed to gain an advantage in lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important not to force trades but to avoid Gangplank's barrels while spreading poison on minions to secure CS. Next, taking aggressive actions when Gangplank's barrels are on cooldown or when vision is limited can create opportunities for harassment. Furthermore, after level 3, proxy farming and applying pressure with Teleport can put pressure on Gangplank. In team fights, acting as a tank and pinning down Gangplank's carry can help the allies' backline deal damage more easily.",
      "カミール": "Camille is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's Q and barrels provide very strong poke, making it difficult for Camille to withstand. Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in lane, which makes Camille susceptible to damage in the early game. Additionally, Gangplank has a powerful ultimate after level 6, making it nearly impossible to win a 1v1 all-in. Furthermore, since Camille relies on auto-attacks, it becomes harder to deal damage when Gangplank destroys her barrels.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play aggressively at early levels to force Gangplank to back off. Taking Second Wind and using a Doran's Shield can help increase survivability against poke in lane. Also, trying to trade after Gangplank uses his Q with E and Q can increase the chances of dealing damage. If you can force Gangplank to back before 1050 gold, your chances of winning an all-in increase significantly. Additionally, putting points into W to enhance sustain and waiting for team fights can also be effective.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank can easily harass Renekton, who is weak in the early game, especially with his barrel attacks that allow him to deal damage while maintaining distance. Additionally, Gangplank's skills have long range, often allowing him to deal damage before Renekton can get close. Furthermore, Gangplank can cleanse crowd control with his W while healing, making it easier to absorb Renekton's attacks. Moreover, Gangplank's ultimate has infinite range, making it easy for him to assist other lanes, which makes it difficult for Renekton to gain an advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to apply pressure actively from the early game. Having a Doran's Shield and securing CS while aiming for an all-in with W→E at level 2 is a good strategy. Also, when Gangplank places a barrel, it is crucial to approach aggressively and attack, taking advantage of the openings after he uses the barrel. In terms of item build, purchasing Tiamat early to enhance combos is effective. Focusing on short trades and using the combo E→Auto→W→Q→E to deplete the opponent's mana is also useful. After level 6, utilize your ultimate to look for all-in opportunities. Coordination with the jungler is also important; when Gangplank makes a mistake, it is beneficial to actively call for assistance.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's barrel damage and healing abilities are very strong against Teemo. Teemo primarily relies on auto-attacks, and Gangplank's Q, which has a blind effect, can nullify Teemo's damage. Additionally, Gangplank has long-range skills and excels at harassing in lane, making it difficult for Teemo to maintain distance. Furthermore, Teemo has low base durability and is vulnerable to Gangplank's skill combos.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to use E to apply slow and poke with Q while aiming for the blind effect. By not pushing the minions too much and poking from outside the barrel's range, you can avoid Gangplank's counterattacks. Also, after level 6, placing mushrooms in bushes or on the side can help secure vision and limit Gangplank's movements. Additionally, when the jungle is about to come, it is advisable to play safe and back off to increase resistance to ganks.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at harassing from a distance, particularly with his barrels, which provide strong zoning. Warwick's playstyle relies on getting close and trading blows, but Gangplank's barrels keep him at bay, making it difficult for Warwick to engage. Additionally, Gangplank's skills have short cooldowns and can deal high damage in team fights, putting Warwick at a disadvantage when trying to go for extended trades. Furthermore, Gangplank can cleanse crowd control and heal with his W, making it easier for him to shrug off Warwick's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to constantly check the positioning of Gangplank's barrels in the early laning phase and to look for opportunities to trade aggressively when he has no barrels available. Also, using minions to time your approach to Gangplank and trading with your Q can be effective. Managing vision and destroying Gangplank's barrels can also help reduce his harassment. Additionally, in terms of item build, opting for Trinity Force or Black Cleaver and building tankier can increase your durability and allow you to engage in longer trades.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's long-range attacks and barrel control are extremely powerful. Gangplank has a long skill range and excels at harassing with barrels. In particular, Yorick relies on his pets, making trades difficult due to the barrels. Additionally, Gangplank's burst damage is high, and early-game Yorick has low base stats, making him vulnerable to Gangplank's attacks. Furthermore, Gangplank can remove crowd control with his W, making Yorick's E trades less effective.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early lane phase, be aware of Gangplank's barrels and maintain distance. Try to time your E to cancel the barrels and avoid trades. Also, after level 6, utilizing your R (Maiden) for split pushing can effectively apply pressure before Gangplank can participate in team fights. Additionally, consider choosing Flash and Teleport as summoner spells to leave the lane or influence other lanes as needed.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's ranged harassment is very strong, especially the poke from his barrels, which can be troublesome for Darius. Darius has a short range and is likely to be whittled down by Gangplank's skills before he can close the gap. Additionally, Gangplank can cleanse CC and heal with his W, making it easier for him to mitigate Darius's attacks. Furthermore, Darius has low mobility, and when Gangplank's barrels are destroyed, the opportunities to deal damage decrease.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, position yourself cleverly behind minions to avoid stepping on Gangplank's barrels. Next, stack Hemorrhage with short auto-attacks and Q, and increase your chances of dealing damage by pulling with E and countering with W. Also, after level 6, you can aim for kills using your ultimate, so it is effective to time your full combo when Gangplank does not have barrels available. In team fights, focus on cutting the side to deal with the carry and reading the timing of Gangplank's barrel detonations is crucial.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank has long-range skills from the early game and excels at harassing in lane, making it difficult for Gragas to approach. In particular, when Gragas takes damage from Gangplank's barrels, he often loses the opportunity to retaliate. Additionally, Gangplank can cleanse CC and heal with his W, allowing him to absorb Gragas's attacks and making it hard to deal sustained damage. Furthermore, Gangplank scales with critical hits and the secondary damage from barrels, becoming stronger over time, which makes it difficult for Gragas to gain an advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, in the early game, be aware of the cooldown on Gangplank's barrels and try to engage when they are on cooldown. Use E to close the gap and time your Q and W for burst damage. Also, position yourself to avoid having your barrels destroyed and maneuver to dodge Gangplank's barrels. After level 6, you can use your R to knock Gangplank's barrels away, aiming for key picks or disruptions in team fights to turn the tide in your favor. In terms of items, focus on toughness while also considering building AP early if necessary to increase your damage output.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's long-range skills and barrel harassment are very powerful, and since Malphite is a melee champion, he is susceptible to Gangplank's attacks. In particular, the long-range poke from Gangplank's Q and the significant damage from barrel combos make Malphite vulnerable to early harassment. Additionally, Gangplank can cleanse crowd control with his W while healing, which diminishes the effectiveness of Malphite's E that reduces attack power, further contributing to the disadvantage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to be mindful of positioning in the lane and avoid stepping on Gangplank's barrels. It can also be effective to return poke with Q before taking damage from Gangplank's attacks using E. When Gangplank places barrels, it is advisable not to engage recklessly but to either destroy the barrels first or coordinate with the jungle for an all-in attack. Furthermore, purchasing Bramble Vest as a core item early on to reduce Gangplank's healing is also crucial.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank's long-range Q poke and zoning with barrels are extremely powerful. Gangplank can establish control over the lane early by placing barrels, making it difficult for Yasuo to approach. Additionally, by using Gangplank's oranges (W), he can withstand Yasuo's all-in attempts, and there is also the risk of taking significant damage from barrel explosions. While Yasuo is strong in close combat, if Gangplank manages his skills well, it limits Yasuo's opportunities to engage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play safely behind minions in the early game and be aware of the range of Gangplank's barrels. During barrel cooldowns, Yasuo can initiate small skirmishes with E→Q to create a health advantage. Additionally, conserving Wind Wall (W) to block Gangplank's Q and barrel explosions, and then securing a knock-up before going for a full combo is effective. After level 6, it is necessary to actively engage while keeping an eye on the positions of Gangplank's oranges and barrels. In team fights, it is effective to disrupt barrels, block important long-range attacks with Wind Wall, and engage from the side."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Mundo has a high self-healing ability and is characterized by a playstyle that involves fighting while consuming HP. Gangplank excels at harassing from a distance using his barrels in the early game, but Dr. Mundo can heal that damage, allowing him to sustain in fights. Additionally, Dr. Mundo's passive allows him to negate crowd control effects, enabling him to maneuver without worrying about Gangplank's CC.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, avoid unnecessary close-range attacks and farm from a distance with Q while being mindful of Gangplank's barrels. If your health gets low, safely return to heal, and after level 6, utilize your sustain to create distance while looking for opportunities for ally ganks or side pushes. Focus on durability when purchasing items, and it's important to buy armor-oriented items early as a counter to Gangplank. In team fights, be mindful of barrel placements while maintaining your healing at the front line to gain an advantage.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has sustained healing abilities and can use his W to become invulnerable and avoid Gangplank's barrel harassment. Additionally, Bloodmire has sustain from his Q, making him good at maintaining the lane. In the early game, Gangplank has low base stats and struggles to deal damage, especially until he levels up, allowing Bloodmire to take advantage.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, it's important not to engage too aggressively in the early game. Instead, focus on clearing minions with E while using W to dodge Gangplank's barrels. Repeatedly use Q for short trades to gradually chip away at the opponent's HP. Once the mid-game begins, you can use R to amplify your damage and gain an advantage by engaging quickly. Also, positioning yourself to avoid stepping on barrels and coordinating with your jungler to aim for burst damage can create even more favorable situations.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath is strong in close combat and has effective crowd control against Gangplank's ranged attacks. In particular, by utilizing the continuous damage from his E and the knock-up from his Q, he can destroy Gangplank's barrels and suppress his harassment. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration, which gives him great sustainability in lane and makes it easier to withstand Gangplank's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning, avoid getting close while Gangplank is placing barrels, and approach when he has used them. Clear minions with E while earning potion healing from his passive, and aim to hit Q when Gangplank places a barrel to disrupt him. Approach during the cooldown of the barrels, land a knock-up with Q after an auto-attack, and silence him with W to execute a long combo. After level 6, utilize R to aim for kills, and by forcing Gangplank to use his W first before attacking, you can play even more advantageously.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled has a powerful all-in ability between levels 1 and 3, allowing him to aggressively engage against Gangplank. In particular, he can close the distance using his Q and charge in, and with a W auto-attack burst, he can secure an early victory. Additionally, while Skaarl is present, Kled doesn't need to retreat unnecessarily and has high durability, making him less susceptible to Gangplank's harassment.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, Kled should actively engage in the early lane phase and break Gangplank's barrels (E) to reduce his harassment. As levels increase, Kled can roam after securing kills and join other lanes with his R to create an advantage for the entire team. Moreover, aiming for a quick resolution before Gangplank sets up his barrels is key to preventing him from showcasing his strength in team fights.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has high mobility and can negate Gangplank's basic and ranged attacks with her W (Hallowed Mist), making trades in the lane favorable. Additionally, Gwen's skills deal effective percentage damage to tanks, allowing her to inflict strong damage against Gangplank's low base stats in the early game. Furthermore, being in the mist makes it easier for Gwen to avoid enemy attacks, giving her high survivability in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (1-5), it is important to maintain distance to avoid being harassed by Gangplank's Q while securing CS with Q and protecting the minions. If barrels are placed, you can either destroy them from a distance or approach and break them with E to avoid Gangplank's harassment. After level 3, engage in short trades with E→Q→AA, using W to negate the opponent's AA and attack safely.\n\nFrom the mid-game (6) onwards, utilize the full potential of R while approaching with W and looking to chase with R + E. Be mindful of barrel management, watch out for chains between barrels, and in team fights, push the frontline with W while dealing high single-target damage with R. It is also important to pay attention to positioning against Gangplank's barrels and cannonballs, maintaining a favorable situation at all times.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control and excels at managing Gangplank's barrels. Gangplank has a long skill range and is good at harassment, but K'Sante can absorb that damage by using his E to shield himself, allowing him to counterattack while maintaining durability. Additionally, in K'Sante's all-out state, his attack power increases, enhancing his one-on-one performance, making it easier to counter Gangplank in the late game.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to farm near your tower first and let Gangplank push. This makes it harder to receive harassment from Gangplank. Also, acquiring Exhaust at level 6 and aiming for an all-in strategy is effective. Furthermore, choosing Randuin's as the second or third item can reduce Gangplank's critical damage. Utilizing the E shield during trades and counterattacking while absorbing Gangplank's attacks is the key to victory.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high mobility and can deal burst damage, giving her an edge in close combat. Gangplank excels at long-range attacks, but he is vulnerable when approached, and if he gets caught by Irelia's E, it creates an opportunity to deal significant damage. Additionally, Irelia can use her Q to clear minions while maintaining her passive, making it easier to prioritize CS in the lane.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, use Q on minions to maintain your passive while prioritizing the lane. Always check the position of Gangplank's barrels, mitigate damage with W, and when E lands, engage with Q to aim for a reset. After level 6, look to engage quickly and aim to take him down before he can use his barrels. In team fights, flank and target the carry, utilizing Irelia's burst damage effectively.",
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Kail becomes Ranged and can deal powerful DPS, allowing her to safely harass while avoiding Gangplank's barrels. Additionally, Kail's W skill creates an invulnerable state, making it easier to avoid Gangplank's burst damage, especially during team fights or crucial trades.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to position yourself to avoid Gangplank's barrels in the early game and safely farm minions. Once you reach level 6, use your R to negate Gangplank's attacks and create opportunities for counterattacks. In the mid-game, participate in team fights after completing your items, utilizing your R to protect allies while targeting Gangplank. Also, by side-pushing and isolating Gangplank, you can create a more advantageous situation.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus is a very powerful stacking champion in the late game, and his damage scales infinitely by last-hitting minions. In contrast, Gangplank has strong burst damage in the early game, but his base stats are low, making it difficult for him to play favorably against Nasus, especially in the early stages. Additionally, Nasus can apply a slow with his W, which can limit Gangplank's movements.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to stack minions with Q in the early game without forcing it. You need to avoid Gangplank's barrels while using health regeneration to sustain. Between 3 to 6 minutes, try to either have enemies step on the barrels or let your allies deal with them, avoiding stepping on them yourself. If you can freeze the minions and safely stack Q, you can progress favorably into the later stages.\n\nAfter level 6, you can use TP to join side lanes or attempt tower dives. After applying a slow with W, it is important to attack with E and Q to create a situation where Gangplank cannot withstand the damage. If you stack up during the mid to late game, you can gain an advantage in direct confrontations against Gangplank and secure victory.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn has high mobility and excels in single-target trades, allowing her to attack while avoiding Gangplank's barrels. Particularly, the blind effect of her Q can disrupt Gangplank's auto-attacks and Parrrley, making it easier to gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, Gangplank is weak in the early game and has low base stats, making him susceptible to Quinn's burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, start by poking from a distance with Q in the early laning phase, maintaining an advantageous position with auto-attacks. Aim for a short engage with E at level 2, and it's important to avoid crossing directly in front of Gangplank to dodge his barrels, instead going around corners to evade the explosion radius. Keep trades short, utilizing the blind from Q to hinder Gangplank's attacks, and retreat with a quick Q + AA. Look for opportunities to engage with E → AA when there are few barrels or when they are on cooldown, while being mindful of support and jungle coverage to create advantageous situations.\n\nAfter pushing the lane, using R to roam and aim for kills in other lanes can also be effective. Since Gangplank's barrels are powerful in team fights, performing split pushes in situations where you can win 1v1 can lead to further advantages.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen can intervene from the side with his R and is able to maintain the frontline easily as a tank. Additionally, by using Shen's E to close the gap and trading with AA→Q, he can counter Gangplank's long-range harassment. Furthermore, Shen can negate Gangplank's barrels and attacks with his W, making it easier to create advantageous situations while reducing damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to always be wary of Gangplank's barrels in the early game and not to chase too deep if they are placed in an unseen position. During skirmishes, close the distance with E for short trades and mitigate damage with W. From mid to late game, Shen can side push and use his R to assist allies, increasing his influence in team fights and objective contests. Being aware of barrel positioning and the timing of W can determine the outcome, so it's crucial to keep these in mind while playing.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum is strong in early skirmishes and can approach while avoiding Gangplank's ranged attacks and barrels. Gangplank is weak in the early game and has low base stats, making him vulnerable to Braum's attacks. Additionally, by using Braum's CC skill, the stun, it becomes easier to limit Gangplank's movements and deal damage.\n\nTo take advantage, first, manage the lane at the start by being aware of Gangplank's barrels and not pushing the minions too much. Look for moments when there are no barrels placed to approach, attack with Q, and prepare to escape by increasing your movement speed with W. After level 6, you can use R to chase and aggressively attack Gangplank. It's also important to secure vision and destroy Gangplank's barrels. This will reduce Gangplank's harassment and help establish an advantage in the lane."

      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control skills and is strong in short trades. Particularly, in K'Sante's all-out state, his attack power significantly increases, enhancing his one-on-one performance. In contrast, Dr. Mundo lacks crowd control in the early game, making him susceptible to damage when he receives K'Sante's combos during short trades. Additionally, K'Sante excels at manipulating minion waves to bait jungle intervention, while Dr. Mundo relies on healing, making it difficult for him to deal with early pressure.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to manage minions thoroughly and avoid K'Sante's short trades. Specifically, positioning yourself to avoid K'Sante's Q and maneuvering to dodge his crowd control is important. Also, be cautious of K'Sante's ultimate around level 6 and avoid unnecessary fights. By being aware of jungle intervention and utilizing teleport to prepare for team fights, you can alleviate K'Sante's strengths. In the mid to late game, building durability items to enhance your healing allows you to aim for opportunities to crush K'Sante in prolonged engagements.",
      "セト": "Set is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control (CC) skills, particularly using stuns and knockbacks to hinder Set's approach. Additionally, in K'Sante's all-out state, his damage significantly increases, enhancing his one-on-one performance, which poses a risk for Set when he tries to engage. Furthermore, K'Sante can take advantageous positions against Set, who has a short range, allowing him to attack while avoiding Set's skills. Since Set has limited means of approaching, he often finds himself in a disadvantageous situation when caught by K'Sante's CC.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively trade from levels 1 to 6 and avoid K'Sante's CC. Specifically, after forcing K'Sante to use his W, it is crucial to use E or R effectively to avoid wasting opportunities. Acquiring the Blade of the Ruined King (BoTRK) early can also apply pressure on K'Sante through short bursts of damage. Additionally, utilizing Lethal Tempo to zone K'Sante from the wave may help maintain lane dominance.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control, and his W's stun is particularly troublesome. Irelia is weak against crowd control, and when she gets hit by K'Sante's skills, she finds herself in a tough situation. Additionally, K'Sante deals high damage in an all-out state, which enhances his dueling performance, so extra caution is needed after level 6. Furthermore, K'Sante's strong poke with normal attacks and Q against Irelia, who has short range, makes it difficult for her to approach.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid K'Sante's W first. This can significantly reduce K'Sante's damage. Fighting near minions also makes it easier to dodge K'Sante's skills. In terms of items, purchasing Blade of the Ruined King (BORK) and Steelcaps early to increase durability is effective. Moreover, after acquiring three items, Irelia's damage output increases, so it is important to maintain the lane and prioritize farming during that time.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of CC skills and, especially in an all-out state, demonstrates high durability and damage. Braum has a short range and his main skills target a single enemy, making him susceptible to K'Sante's counterattacks. Additionally, K'Sante has skills for shields and repositioning, allowing him to dodge Braum's attacks, which becomes unfavorable in prolonged fights. Furthermore, K'Sante excels in one-on-one situations, and even if Braum gains an advantage in short skirmishes, he must be cautious of K'Sante's counterattacks after level 6.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on short trades during the early laning phase and to disengage when K'Sante uses his shield or repositioning skills without forcing the issue. Proper minion management is also effective, pushing the opponent to create a level difference. After level 6, be wary of K'Sante's ultimate and ensure to engage safely after securing CC or vision. In terms of item selection, prioritizing health while considering penetration and mobility to look for kill opportunities is crucial. In team fights, aim to take the initiative, and if unable to secure a kill, it is necessary to make the decision to retreat rather than forcing the fight.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has strong pressure from early to mid-game, particularly because he can easily disrupt Nasus's Q stacks. By utilizing K'Sante's CC skills (stuns and knockbacks), he can hinder Nasus's farming, making it difficult for Nasus to farm in the early game. Additionally, K'Sante has high burst damage in an all-out state, which means Nasus can take significant damage before he has a chance to scale. Furthermore, Nasus only has a slow as a means of closing the gap, making it hard for him to counter K'Sante's mobility.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS (especially Q stacks) without forcing fights in the early game. Farming near the tower and purchasing Doran's Shield to increase durability is advisable. Around level 6, be cautious of K'Sante's full combo and try to time Wither (W) before taking damage to gain an advantage. Also, consider saving Flash and using TP to apply side pressure when necessary. Regarding the build, adopting Grasp and choosing defensive items (Bramble/Armor, Plated Steelcaps) will ensure durability, and obtaining CDR through freezing items (Frozen Heart) or Spirit Visage can be effective. In team fights, it is crucial to collect Qs at the frontline, use Wither to neutralize K'Sante when he engages, and endure while dealing damage in the later stages.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control (CC) skills, particularly excelling at using stuns and knockbacks to limit Warwick's movements. Warwick's strength lies in his sustained damage in close combat, but unless he targets the timing when K'Sante's shields and CC are down, it becomes difficult to utilize Warwick's Q for healing. Additionally, K'Sante deals high damage in an all-out state, enhancing his one-on-one performance, making it easier for Warwick to be counterattacked when he tries to engage. Furthermore, K'Sante can maneuver advantageously against Warwick's short range, making it easier to maintain lane dominance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to focus on short trades in the early game to avoid K'Sante's shields and CC. Specifically, attacking after K'Sante has used his CC can reduce the risk of counterattacks. Additionally, securing vision and being wary of jungle interventions can help avoid one-on-one situations with K'Sante. In the mid to late game, building tank-oriented items and fulfilling a role in team fights can increase opportunities to counter K'Sante.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage. The reason is that K'Sante has abundant CC skills, and especially in an all-out state, his attack power and mobility increase, allowing him to deal powerful damage to Ornn. Additionally, K'Sante has an advantage in one-on-one situations against Ornn, who has short range, and particularly after level 6, he can overwhelm Ornn with strong damage and CC from his ultimate. Furthermore, K'Sante has a high ability to avoid Ornn's skills and is also strong against champions that can negate Ornn's CC.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to seek jungle support early on. Before level 6, there is a chance to win against K'Sante, so focus on dodging his Q and use fake auto-attacks or fake E after using W to trigger Brittle. After level 6, it is crucial to use W to waste K'Sante's ultimate and maintain distance while fighting. In terms of item build, purchasing Tabis and then choosing Sunfire or Heartsteel can enhance durability. In team fights, play calmly and stack armor to counter K'Sante's physical damage.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante is strong in prolonged fights, has high durability, and possesses self-healing abilities. K'Sante increases damage when in all-out state, making him strong in one-on-one situations. On the other hand, Malphite has hard CC only with his R, and in long fights, he becomes disadvantaged when facing K'Sante's shields and CC. Additionally, K'Sante excels at counterattacking in close combat and can easily deflect Malphite's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Play cautiously in the early game, avoiding K'Sante's skills while harassing with Q.\n2. After level 3, avoid prolonged fights and focus on short trades.\n3. Save R and use it as a counter when K'Sante is in all-out state.\n4. Coordinate with teammates to isolate K'Sante, creating advantageous situations.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has a wealth of CC skills, particularly excelling at using stuns and knockbacks to limit Jax's actions. Jax is a champion that relies on auto-attacks (AA), and K'Sante's shields and CC can easily cause him to miss his attack timing. Additionally, K'Sante deals high damage in an all-out state and has excellent one-on-one performance, meaning Jax could take significant damage before he can close the gap. Furthermore, K'Sante can take advantageous positions against Jax, who has short range, making it particularly easy for K'Sante to harass Jax during the laning phase.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Avoiding fights**: It is crucial to avoid early fights with K'Sante and endure the lane, especially avoiding fights under the tower.\n\n2. **Short trades**: Use Q and W for short trades while keeping E ready to dodge K'Sante's attacks.\n\n3. **Item build**: Prioritize items like Hydra and Triforce, adjusting the build with K'Sante's items in mind. It is especially important to play favorably before K'Sante rushes to build Iceborn Gauntlet.\n\n4. **Proxy strategy**: Use Ghost or TP to pressure K'Sante when there are no minions, allowing you to clear the wave while targeting the enemy jungle.\n\n5. **Team fights**: In team fights, you can avoid K'Sante's CC by triggering his W before using E, allowing you to deal damage while evading his crowd control.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can mitigate Jax's disadvantages and aim to become stronger in the late game.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante excels in short-term melee skirmishes, especially in an all-out state where his attack power and mobility increase. K'Sante's burst damage from his Q is very high, and Cho'Gath finds himself in a tough situation when he takes that hit. Additionally, K'Sante has a wealth of crowd control, particularly using stuns and knockbacks to limit Cho'Gath's actions. Furthermore, K'Sante can maneuver advantageously against the short-range Cho'Gath, making it difficult for him to maintain distance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to manage minions thoroughly and bait K'Sante's Q to create opportunities for counterattacks. It is also effective to keep track of K'Sante's skill cooldowns and time your counterattacks after he uses his W. At level 6, you need to be wary of K'Sante's R and utilize shields and defensive skills to endure. Additionally, when roaming or intervening in the jungle, securing vision and coordinating with teammates to combine burst damage can increase your chances of countering K'Sante.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante excels in close-range brawling and has abundant crowd control, making him very troublesome when he gets close. In K'Sante's all-out state, his attack power significantly increases, enhancing his one-on-one performance, which puts Gangplank at a high risk of being at a disadvantage in close combat. Additionally, K'Sante has high durability as a tank, making it difficult for Gangplank's barrels to harass him effectively. Furthermore, K'Sante can take advantage of his short range by closing the distance, forcing Gangplank to maintain distance, but he becomes disadvantaged when K'Sante approaches.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to place barrels behind minions in the early game and farm and poke with Q without forcing trades. When K'Sante charges in, retreating and counterattacking with barrels can help maintain distance. After level 6, it is crucial to be wary of K'Sante's dives and to save Flash for escape preparation. In terms of itemization, setting penetration items as the ultimate goal while surviving in the early game with HP and armor can increase durability against K'Sante. In team fights, contributing with long-range shots and R while leaving the safe handling of K'Sante to allies can reduce risk.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante is strong in close combat and has abundant crowd control, making it easier to manage Urgot's attacks. Especially in K'Sante's all-out state, his damage increases and his one-on-one performance improves, making it difficult for Urgot to aim for a quick finish. Additionally, K'Sante has a shield that can mitigate Urgot's damage. Furthermore, K'Sante can maneuver advantageously against Urgot, who has a short range, making it hard for Urgot to approach.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Minion Management**: Use minions to maintain distance from K'Sante and focus on chipping away with Q.\n2. **Utilize Ganks**: Coordinate with the jungler to gank K'Sante and create an advantageous situation early on.\n3. **Item Selection**: Purchase Black Cleaver and armor early to increase durability while maintaining range to avoid K'Sante's attacks.\n4. **Leverage Level Differences**: After level 3, focus on short trades while avoiding K'Sante's crowd control. It is particularly important to time avoiding K'Sante's R correctly.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has high durability and abundant crowd control, and especially in all-out situations, his damage significantly increases. Aatrox has long skill animations, making it difficult to hit mobile opponents, which makes it hard to avoid K'Sante's attacks. Additionally, K'Sante can reduce Aatrox's damage by stacking armor and has strong counters to his skills. In particular, K'Sante's percentage health damage poses a threat to Aatrox.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to build armor penetration first. Specifically, purchasing Black Cleaver early to reduce K'Sante's armor can effectively increase damage. Choosing Divine Sunderer can also enhance healing, allowing for an advantage in prolonged fights. In team fights, utilizing the healing from Goredrinker to mitigate K'Sante's damage should also be considered. Furthermore, it is crucial to effectively use Aatrox's E to avoid K'Sante's skills and time attacks carefully."

    "loses": {
      "ケイル": "Kail has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that after level 6, Kail can attack from range and can deal powerful DPS, allowing her to fight while keeping distance from K'Sante's melee attacks. Additionally, Kail's ultimate can create an invulnerable state, making it easier to avoid K'Sante's CC and damage, especially when facing an all-out K'Sante.\n\nTo gain the advantage, prioritize safety from the start until level 6, securing experience without engaging with minions. Use wards to watch for ganks, avoid short trades, aim for last hits with Q, and clear minions with E. After level 6, use the ultimate to prevent damage and initiate attacks after returning. Utilize long-range slows to disrupt K'Sante's movements, and in team fights, maintain a position in the backline while attacking to maximize Kail's strengths.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reasons are that Yone possesses high mobility and DPS, particularly being able to attack while avoiding K'Sante's CC. K'Sante is a melee champion with a short range, making him highly susceptible to Yone's ranged attacks. Additionally, Yone can use his skills without consuming mana, allowing him to maintain the lane effectively and apply continuous pressure on K'Sante.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, it is important to perform short attacks with W between levels 1 and 3 while prioritizing CS with Q and avoiding K'Sante's approach. In trades, using E to dodge the opponent's CC and counterattacking after forcing K'Sante to use his skills is effective. After level 6, using R to chase down K'Sante while being cautious of his defensive skills can lead to advantageous one-shots. Furthermore, preparing items early and focusing on penetration and attack speed can maximize damage against K'Sante.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has sustained damage from a distance and can harass K'Sante while clearing minions with his Q. Additionally, if Rumble manages his heat well, he can deal continuous damage, preventing K'Sante from approaching and allowing him to push the lane. Furthermore, Rumble's ultimate deals sustained damage and applies a slow to enemies within its range, creating an escape route when K'Sante charges in and providing an opportunity for counterattack.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use Q to clear minions in the early lane phase while managing heat to maintain an aggressive posture. When K'Sante approaches, apply a slow with E and then harass with Q to limit the opponent's movement. Be mindful of wave management, push the minions to secure vision, and aim for roams to impact other lanes effectively. In team fights, placing the ultimate in the right position and cutting off K'Sante's charge route will facilitate coordination with allies.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has sustained healing abilities, allowing him to farm CS while enduring attacks from K'Sante. Bloodmire's Q provides sustain that mitigates K'Sante's damage and helps him maintain lane control. Additionally, K'Sante has a short range, making it difficult for him to retaliate against Bloodmire's ranged attacks. Furthermore, by utilizing Bloodmire's W's invulnerability effect, it becomes easier to avoid K'Sante's CC, enabling him to deal sustained damage in team fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, during the laning phase, use Q to attack enemy champions while healing and farming CS. When taking damage from K'Sante, it is crucial to use W to become invulnerable and avoid damage. Also, by using E to pull K'Sante, you can disable his skills and create opportunities for counterattacks. In team fights, dealing damage from the backline while using R at the right moment to increase survivability is key. This way, Bloodmire can maneuver advantageously against K'Sante.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has powerful percentage damage against K'Sante, allowing her to gain an edge, especially in one-on-one combat. Although K'Sante has high durability, he becomes vulnerable when in an all-out state, making it easier for Fiora to exploit that opening and deal damage. Additionally, by using Fiora's W (Riposte), she can negate K'Sante's crowd control and create opportunities for counterattacks.\n\nTo take advantage, first aim for the vitals near the minions in the early lane phase, parry K'Sante's crowd control with W, and then initiate an attack with Q. It's important to avoid prolonged skirmishes and aim for quick resolutions. In the mid-game and beyond, create 1v1 situations in the side lanes and time your attacks for when K'Sante's R effect wears off. Also, choosing items like Last Whisper will make it easier to penetrate K'Sante's defenses.",
      "ヴェイン": "Vayne has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Vayne possesses high mobility and true damage against K'Sante, allowing her to gain an edge, especially in the late game scaling. K'Sante can easily suppress Vayne in the early game with his durability and crowd control, but Vayne can aim for a guaranteed stun on K'Sante using her wall combo (E), which enables her to deal significant damage. Additionally, K'Sante becomes vulnerable in his all-out state, allowing Vayne to turn the tables if she engages at the right moment.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the lane, prioritize safety by using auto-attacks and Q in small bursts under the minions while being cautious of K'Sante's crowd control during trades. When you corner K'Sante against a wall, use E to aim for a guaranteed stun and create an opportunity to deal damage. Furthermore, during roams and team fights, it's crucial to create situations where you can take him down in one hit and to engage only after confirming your support's peel. This way, you can neutralize K'Sante's strengths while leveraging your own.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo possesses high mobility and knock-up, allowing him to maneuver favorably in short trades against K'Sante. K'Sante is strong in early short trades, but Yasuo can use minions to charge his Q, dealing damage while avoiding K'Sante's attacks. Additionally, by using E to dodge K'Sante's CC, Yasuo can minimize incoming damage.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, use minions to charge Q and farm safely in front of the tower. Avoid unnecessary engages, reposition with E in response to K'Sante's E or charges, and evade his attacks. To create opportunities for knock-ups, utilize allied minions and jungle interventions, being careful not to chase too deep alone. In the mid-lane phase, recall to equip items, prioritize farming, and secure sustain with items and lifesteal. In team fights, it is crucial to enter from the side and aim for high-value targets with knock-up followed by R. Instead of continuously hitting a tank alone, coordinating with allies will work to Yasuo's advantage against K'Sante.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, particularly having an advantage in long fights against K'Sante's short-term burst. Singed's poison deals continuous damage, allowing him to capitalize on that poison when K'Sante approaches. Additionally, Singed can proxy farm, making it easier to create a difference in experience and gold by pushing the lane. Furthermore, by using Singed's flip (E), he can disrupt K'Sante's attacks and create distance.\n\nTo take advantage, first push the lane early and apply pressure on K'Sante through proxy farming. When K'Sante approaches the minions, use the flip (E) to throw him back and let the minions deal damage. Also, continue to spread poison (Q) before K'Sante goes all-in to maintain an advantage in close combat. In team fights, it is crucial to run towards the enemy backline and pin down their tank, making it easier for allies to deal damage.",
      "ポッピー": "Poppy has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Poppy has strong crowd control (CC) against K'Sante, particularly excelling at disrupting K'Sante's attacks. By using Poppy's E (Breaker), she can avoid K'Sante's skills while maintaining distance, reducing the risk of taking damage from K'Sante's attacks. Additionally, Poppy's Q (Steel Pan) allows her to chip away at K'Sante's health, especially when K'Sante is in an all-in state, making it possible to exploit his vulnerability.\n\nTo gain the advantage, during the laning phase, Poppy should utilize her E to dodge K'Sante's skills while dealing damage with her Q. Attacking after K'Sante uses his W (Shield) allows her to target a moment when his defenses are weak. Furthermore, Poppy is also strong against ganks; by coordinating with her jungler to gank when K'Sante is isolated, she can establish dominance.\n\nIn team fights, Poppy plays the role of a tank at the front line, disrupting the enemy carry and timing her R (Stun Bash) to negate K'Sante's crucial skills is essential. This will enable her team to gain an advantage in the battle.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high sustained damage against K'Sante, and by using his Q (Silence), he can prevent K'Sante from using his skills. This effectively nullifies K'Sante's CC and shields, allowing Garen to maintain an advantage in one-on-one situations. Additionally, Garen's R (Ultimate) deals true damage, which can inflict significant damage while ignoring K'Sante's durability, making it particularly powerful against K'Sante in an all-out situation.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Garen should use his Q to silence K'Sante and then aim for a short combo with E (Demacian Justice) to deal damage. After K'Sante uses his shields or durability skills, Garen can attack again to deplete the opponent's resources. Since prolonged fights are unfavorable, it's important to time the use of R to secure kills, utilizing support from towers or the jungle to unleash burst damage. Furthermore, by using Garen's W (Courage) to reduce damage, he can absorb the opponent's attacks and engage in combat more safely.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high mobility and strong traits for short trades in close combat. K'Sante has a short range and is particularly disadvantaged against champions with long-range attacks, but Camille can use her mobility to avoid K'Sante's attacks while dealing damage with her Q. Additionally, Camille's passive shield helps mitigate K'Sante's damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use Q at level 1 and actively engage K'Sante. After acquiring W at level 2, you should perform normal attacks while avoiding K'Sante's attacks, adopting a strategy to bully the tank. If you can avoid K'Sante's CC skills, Camille will find it easier to execute favorable trades. Also, by being aware of K'Sante's all-out state and timing your attacks, you can deal damage more effectively.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi has high sustained damage and can gain an edge in fights, especially when using her W. While K'Sante has crowd control, Illaoi's attacks utilizing her tentacles can deal continuous damage in close combat, making it easier to chip away at K'Sante's durability. Additionally, Illaoi excels at minion control in the lane and can apply pressure on K'Sante with her tentacles.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, use W when the minions are clustered together, and pull K'Sante in with E to deal damage. To avoid K'Sante's skills, position yourself wisely and use your tentacles to attack. After level 6, aim for decisive blows with R, summoning multiple tentacles to restrict K'Sante's movements. It is crucial to activate R before K'Sante charges in, dealing damage while creating opportunities for counterattacks. Securing vision and using minions to gain an advantage in fights will be the key to victory.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven possesses high mobility and burst damage, allowing her to gain an edge over K'Sante in short trades. Riven's skills can maximize damage through consecutive use, making it easier to chip away at K'Sante's durability. Additionally, Riven has crowd control, which makes it easier to limit K'Sante's actions, especially in damage trades during close combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to poke in the early game to create a summoner resource difference. Riven can use her Q and E to execute short combos and quickly disengage to avoid K'Sante's counterattacks. After forcing the opponent to use their defensive skills, it's a good idea to engage seriously. Also, focusing on minion management and securing vision allows for safer lane progression. After level 6, it's crucial to be wary of K'Sante's ultimate while considering the timing of Riven's ultimate and flash for an all-in. By aiming for a quick resolution, you can maximize Riven's strengths.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Pantheon has high burst damage in the early game, making him particularly strong in trades from levels 2 to 3. K'Sante is durable, but he is weak against early burst damage, and by executing a short trade with Pantheon's E→Q→AA combo, you can wear down K'Sante's shield and durability. Additionally, Pantheon has strong roaming capabilities, which allows him to influence other lanes easily, adding to his advantages.\n\nTo take advantage, first, push the minions early to pressure K'Sante, then engage with E and deal damage with Q. Attacking after K'Sante uses his shield allows for more effective damage. After level 6, you can use Pantheon's R to roam to other lanes and aim for kills, which can help turn the overall game in your favor. In team fights, you can strip away K'Sante's frontline and target squishy enemy carries, contributing to your team's victory.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas excels at harassing from a distance, particularly using his Q barrel to deal damage to K'Sante while restricting his movement. Additionally, by using Gragas's E, it becomes easier to avoid K'Sante's charges, allowing him to create distance before being engaged in close combat. Furthermore, Gragas can use his W to gain an advantage in short trades, providing opportunities to deal damage before K'Sante goes all-in.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to harass with Q in the early game and use minions to land barrels directly. When K'Sante approaches, using E to dodge and R to create distance allows for safe fighting. Also, after K'Sante uses his skills, finding an opportunity to close in and deal damage with W while aiming for a quick finish is effective. Coordination with the jungle is also crucial; using R to knock K'Sante towards allies and combining it with their crowd control can create advantageous situations.",
      "クレッド": "Kled has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kled is strong in early-game all-ins and excels in short skirmishes. While K'Sante has high durability, his short range makes it difficult to retaliate against Kled's skill combos, especially in the early lane phase. Additionally, Kled's passive health return and skill combos give him a high ability to win tight fights, allowing him to deal damage before getting caught by K'Sante's crowd control.\n\nTo take advantage, Kled should push the lane early and chip away at K'Sante's HP with short combos. Particularly between levels 3 and 6, using Q and W to engage and following up when K'Sante tries to disengage ensures consistent damage. After level 6, Kled can use his R for aggressive engages and aim for kills. It's also important to quickly gather items to boost burst damage and outmatch the opponent's durability.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick excels in prolonged battles and splitting with his summons, making him strong against K'Sante's short trades. K'Sante is good at attacking using shields and crowd control in close combat, but Yorick can generate ghosts with his E and summon the Maiden while restricting the enemy's movement with his W, allowing him to deal sustained damage. Additionally, Yorick is strong at destroying towers and objectives, which enables him to push the lane advantageously.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, manage the minion wave using E in the early game and secure vision with wards. Next, use W to block K'Sante's escape route and actively engage in 1v1 fights when the Maiden is present. When K'Sante approaches, it is important to utilize the Maiden to deal damage while deflecting K'Sante's attacks. Furthermore, employing roaming and teleportation to execute a split strategy and moving sideways based on the enemy jungle's position can help establish an advantage over K'Sante.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremendous has high single-target damage and sustain capabilities, and especially after level 6, he can utilize his ultimate to become invincible and counter K'Sante. K'Sante has a lot of crowd control and high durability, but while Tremendous is weak against that crowd control, he can save K'Sante's skills by timing his all-in. Additionally, Tremendous has strong split-pushing abilities and can maintain his lane easily, which also works in his favor.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use minions to sustain health with Q in the early game and avoid unnecessary long fights. Once you reach level 6, aim for an all-in on K'Sante while using your ultimate to become invulnerable. At this point, you can engage more safely after K'Sante's crowd control has been used. In the mid-game, prioritize armor penetration items and lifesteal items, and it’s effective to join team fights late while pushing the side lanes. If K'Sante tries to group up and pressure, calling for allies to create a 2v1 situation can lead to a more favorable fight.",
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar excels at early harassment in lane and can deal damage with his Q (Boomerang) while avoiding K'Sante's skills. Additionally, when Gnar transforms into Mega Gnar, he has powerful crowd control (CC) and can fight K'Sante favorably. K'Sante has a short range, making it difficult for him to land attacks, especially against Gnar, who has ranged attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to always pay attention to positioning in lane and avoid K'Sante's skills. Look for opportunities to counterattack after K'Sante uses his E (Charge) and continue dealing damage with Q (Boomerang). Be mindful of the transformation gauge, and when you become Mega Gnar, using R (GNAR!) to group K'Sante and apply CC can help your allies deal damage more easily. Additionally, prioritizing tank items in your build to increase durability will allow you to have an advantage in one-on-one encounters with K'Sante."

      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has high base stats due to his transformation, and especially in Mega Gnar form, he possesses powerful crowd control and AoE damage. Braum is primarily a melee champion, but in Gnar's mini form, he has high mobility and can easily dodge Braum's attacks. Additionally, Gnar can mount a strong counterattack against all-ins, and in Mega Gnar form, where Braum's attack speed and movement speed are reduced, he can find himself in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, during levels 1-3, it is effective to leverage Braum's early strength and actively harass Gnar. Being aware of Gnar's transformation and refraining from attacking during his transformation is crucial to timing your dodges against Gnar's skills. Furthermore, after level 6, utilizing Braum's ultimate and timing your all-ins against Gnar while avoiding his skills is necessary. In terms of item build, prioritizing tank items and considering items with magic resistance can help reduce Gnar's damage.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar's powerful crowd control (CC) and high base stats from his transformation make it difficult for Tryndamere to all-in. Especially in Gnar's Mega Gnar state, his skills with stuns and slows can effectively prevent Tryndamere from closing the gap. Additionally, Gnar has high mobility in his Mini Gnar form, making it easier to dodge Tryndamere's attacks. Furthermore, Tryndamere is weak against CC, and being hit by Gnar's CC makes it hard for him to retaliate.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to play aggressively from the early game to create a health advantage. Tryndamere can heal with his Q while increasing his auto-attack damage with his E, disrupting Gnar's positioning. Buying boots early to avoid Gnar's W is also effective. Securing vision and prioritizing farming in the side lanes while disrupting Gnar's Q stacking is crucial. In team fights, prioritizing Gnar and using R to steal durability can help turn the battle in your favor.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has high mobility, especially in mini form, making it difficult for Sett to approach. Gnar can attack from a distance and can harass Sett before he gets close, which is particularly challenging for Sett when Gnar is in mini form due to his low base stats, making him vulnerable to all-ins. Additionally, in Gnar's mega form, he has powerful crowd control (CC), increasing the likelihood that Sett will be countered with stuns or slows when he tries to close the gap. Furthermore, Gnar can manage his transformation timing effectively, allowing him to play favorably against Sett, meaning Sett must always be cautious.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to actively trade when Gnar is in mini form and not miss opportunities to deal damage. Additionally, looking for all-ins when Gnar has wasted his Q or E can provide chances for victory. Applying pressure on Gnar through ganks can also be effective in securing lane dominance. Finally, creatively building items to increase durability is crucial for withstanding Gnar's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has powerful CC skills through his transformation, and especially in Mega form, his AoE damage and stun effect are very strong. Mordekaiser relies on close combat, and since the cooldown of his only approach tool, E, is long, it is difficult to counter Gnar's mobility in Mini form. Additionally, when Gnar is in Mini form, he can easily avoid attacks, making it easy for him to trade against the all-in vulnerable Mordekaiser. Furthermore, when Gnar enters Mega form, it becomes difficult for Mordekaiser to approach due to his low attack speed and movement speed.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to endure until level 6. It is effective to avoid going all-in before Gnar enters Mega form and to wait for his E cooldown before attacking. Additionally, avoiding Gnar's boomerang and baiting his ultimate can help turn the fight in your favor. As for items, having boots and Rylai's to increase mobility is crucial to leverage Mordekaiser's strength in the late game. In team fights, it is advisable to eliminate Gnar before he activates his ultimate or to aim to isolate the carry.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the powerful crowd control (CC) from Gnar's transformation and his high base stats, especially in Mega Gnar form. Riven has many mobility skills, and when hit by Gnar's stun or slow, it becomes difficult to execute her combos. Additionally, Gnar in Mini Gnar form has high mobility, making it likely for him to escape when Riven tries to all-in. Furthermore, Gnar has strong AoE damage in Mega Gnar form, making him a significant threat in team fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Harass in Lane**: Actively harass Gnar when he is in Mini Gnar form to prevent him from building up rage. It is important to deal damage using Q and W while maintaining distance with E.\n\n2. **Item Build**: Aim to gather damage items early to overwhelm Gnar. Also, consider defensive items to withstand Gnar's CC.\n\n3. **Be Aware of Transformation Timing**: Identify the timing when Gnar transforms into Mega Gnar and initiate an attack before that to avoid his powerful CC after the transformation.\n\n4. **Positioning in Team Fights**: Be cautious during Gnar's Mega Gnar form, maintaining distance while targeting the enemy backline. It is essential to avoid Gnar's CC while dealing damage.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, you can mitigate Riven's disadvantages and progress the match in your favor.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has high base stats due to his transformation, and especially in Mega Gnar form, he exhibits powerful crowd control and AoE damage. Gragas has slow skill activation, and particularly takes time to charge his Q, making him susceptible to Gnar's attacks. Additionally, Gnar's mini form is highly mobile, making it difficult for Gragas to close the gap, which can lead to unfavorable situations during harassment or all-ins. Furthermore, Gnar is strong in all-ins, and Gragas has low DPS, often putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively use Q for harassment from the early game to prevent Gnar from stacking his Q. Additionally, using E to restrict Gnar's movement and prevent him from creating escape routes can also be effective. Pushing the lane can make it harder for Gnar to farm, and strengthening coordination with the jungle to aim for kills is also beneficial. In the mid-game and beyond, utilizing your ultimate in team fights to separate Gnar is crucial for creating advantageous situations for your team.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has high mobility in mini form, making it easy for him to poke Garen. Especially with his E skill, Gnar can easily create distance and avoid Garen's attacks. Additionally, when he transforms into mega form, Gnar has powerful crowd control and can all-in on Garen, making Garen very susceptible to being overwhelmed. Furthermore, by managing the timing of his transformation well, Gnar can minimize the damage he takes from Garen's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Garen to play safely and utilize his passive, Second Wind, and Doran's Shield to maintain lane presence. Using Flash and Ghost, along with choosing Phase Rush, allows him to fight while keeping distance from Gnar. It is also effective to engage when Gnar transitions from mega back to mini form. Additionally, placing wards deep in the enemy jungle and remaining vigilant against Gnar and his jungler is crucial.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar excels at harassing with long-range attacks in his mini form, allowing him to deal damage before Darius can get close. Additionally, in his mega form, Gnar has powerful crowd control, making Darius vulnerable to attacks when he tries to approach. Darius has low mobility, making it difficult to counter Gnar's mobility, especially when Gnar is in mini form, which makes it hard for Darius to engage all-in. Furthermore, Gnar can effectively manage his transformation timing to avoid Darius's attacks, making him a very troublesome opponent for Darius.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to aim for a combo of pulling Gnar in with E and then dealing damage with Q when Gnar approaches in mini form. Actively harassing Gnar when he is in mini form and utilizing sustain to dominate the lane is also necessary. Additionally, focusing on armor penetration as an item choice and selecting items that enhance sustain can be effective for prolonging fights. Finally, being cautious of Gnar's mega form timing and positioning to target the backline in team fights can help Darius leverage his strengths.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has high base stats and strong crowd control due to his transformation, and especially in Mega Gnar form, he can absorb Fiora's attacks. While Fiora excels in one-on-one situations, Gnar's W (Wither) reduces her movement speed, and his E (Boomerang) provides crowd control that limits Fiora's mobility. Additionally, Gnar becomes stronger in the late game by stacking his Q (Siphon) early on, so if Fiora cannot apply pressure early, there is a risk of Gnar scaling up.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Fiora to apply pressure actively from the early game and prevent Gnar from stacking his Q. By using her W (Riposte) to parry Gnar's W (Wither) and aiming for a stun, she can create favorable situations against Gnar. Moreover, purchasing items early, especially tank items, can increase her durability and make it easier to withstand Gnar's attacks. Furthermore, proper lane management is required to control the wave so that Gnar cannot safely stack his Q.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar can establish an advantage against Renekton at levels 1 and 2, especially by utilizing Gnar's mobility and range in mini form to avoid Renekton's attacks. Gnar has strong crowd control through his transformation, and in Mega Gnar form, he possesses high base stats, making it likely that he can deal damage before Renekton can engage. Additionally, Renekton's dash (E) has a long cooldown, making it difficult to attack Gnar after using it once. Furthermore, Gnar can negate Renekton's attacks and scales better in the late game, putting Renekton at a disadvantage in extended fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, Renekton should focus on trading at level 1, avoiding Gnar's attacks while managing Fury to set up combos. Attacking after Gnar uses his dash can also exploit Gnar's vulnerabilities. Utilizing the pressure from ganks, coordinating with the allied jungler to apply active pressure on Gnar can be effective as well. As for items, purchasing durability items early to reduce Gnar's damage is beneficial."

    "loses": {
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has high mobility and excels at engaging in small skirmishes against Gnar in his mini form. Gnar's mini form has low base stats and is weak to all-ins, allowing Anbessa to close the distance with E and deal damage with auto-attacks utilizing his passive. Additionally, against Gnar's mega form, Anbessa can avoid Gnar's powerful crowd control by using W to gain a shield while maintaining distance.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase (levels 1-3), prioritize farming while always keeping track of Gnar's mega gauge. When Gnar is in mini form, apply pressure with E → passive → auto-attack, and when he transforms into mega form, play defensively and conserve W to avoid being controlled. After level 6, avoid 1v1s when Gnar is mega, and when he returns to mini form or has a low gauge, engage with R to aim for control. In team fights, it is crucial to use R to access the backline while avoiding Gnar's mega CC and to chase with E's slow.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite can counter Gnar by utilizing his early burst damage and high durability. By stacking armor, Malphite can effectively mitigate Gnar's attacks, especially gaining an advantage against Gnar's low base stats during mini-Gnar form. Additionally, Malphite's R ability provides a knock-up that can limit Gnar's mobility and have a significant impact in team fights and one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to disrupt Gnar's CS with Q in the early lane phase and zone him out. Purchasing Doran's Shield and boots, and equipping armor early will make it easier to withstand Gnar's attacks. Once you reach level 6, you can use your R to engage and aim for a kill with the E→Q combo or force Gnar to use his flash. After that, it is crucial to roam or push towers to secure an advantage across the map. If Gnar is freezing the lane, avoid chasing him unnecessarily and prioritize taking towers with side pushes to build further advantages.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability as a tank and can withstand Gnar's attacks, making him strong against harassment in the lane. Additionally, Ornn's skills have crowd control, and his R ability's knock-up can limit Gnar's movements. Gnar has difficulty managing his transformations, and especially in Mini Gnar form, his base stats are low, making him vulnerable to all-ins when taking damage from Ornn.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize CS in the early game while avoiding Gnar's attacks and harassing with W. As you enter the mid-game, prepare your items and get ready to participate in team fights. Particularly, using R to catch Gnar can secure an advantage in team fights. In the late game, it is important to endure on the front line while protecting your allies and preventing Gnar from targeting the backline.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has high mobility and blink abilities, allowing her to effectively exploit the timing of Gnar's transformation and target his weaknesses during mini-Gnar. In mini form, Gnar has low base stats and is weak to all-ins, so Irelia can gain an advantage by initiating short trades. Additionally, by managing minions with her E while trading with her Q, Irelia can apply pressure on Gnar.\n\nTo take advantage, start by using E to clear minions at the beginning, while avoiding Gnar's boomerang and engaging in mini trades. In the mid-lane phase, keep track of Gnar's mega transformation timing and attack with a short Q → AA → Q reset when he is not in mega form. After level 6, watch Gnar's mega cooldown to aim for all-ins, using E to stun, then closing the distance with Q, and finally going for a guaranteed kill with R. In team fights, be cautious of Gnar's CC while diving into the backline to target the carries.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has sustained healing abilities, making it easier to endure attacks from Gnar. In Gnar's mini form, his attack power is low, and by using Bloodmire's Q (Blood Wave), he can clear minions while healing. Additionally, when Gnar transforms (Mega Gnar), his attack power increases, but by utilizing Bloodmire's W (Invulnerability), it becomes easier to avoid Gnar's powerful attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, first in the laning phase, actively use Bloodmire's Q to clear minions while healing. To avoid Gnar's W (Nashor's Strike), use E (Blood Absorption) at the right timing to prevent taking damage from Gnar's attacks. Furthermore, prioritize building items that increase durability to enhance resistance against Gnar's attacks. In team fights, it is important to act as a damage dealer from the backline, avoiding Gnar's skills while coordinating with teammates.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn possesses high mobility and burst damage, making her particularly strong against Gnar, who has low base stats in his mini form. By utilizing Quinn's passive in combos, she can deal significant damage before Gnar transforms. Additionally, Quinn can attack from a distance, making it easier to harass Gnar before he gets close. Furthermore, when Gnar transforms into Mega Gnar, Quinn can take advantage of his reduced mobility to safely maintain distance while attacking.\n\nTo gain the advantage, the following steps should be executed:\n\n1. **Harass from Level 1**: Quinn can start harassing Gnar with her Q from level 1, establishing an early lead. It's especially easy to deal damage when Gnar is in his mini form.\n\n2. **All-in during Mini Gnar**: When Gnar is in his mini form, approach with W, deal damage with Q, and then either escape with E or continue attacking. It's crucial to all-in before Gnar builds up his rage.\n\n3. **Timing the Transformation**: Assess the timing of Gnar's transformation into Mega Gnar, and after he transforms, maintain distance while attacking. Quickly move with E to avoid Mega Gnar's CC and continue attacking.\n\n4. **Utilize Roaming**: Once a lead is established in lane, roam to target kills in other lanes. Quinn's high mobility allows her to impact other lanes effectively.\n\n5. **Itemization**: Quinn is reliant on her items, so it's important to build them early to enhance her burst damage. Prioritize purchasing items that increase her attack power.\n\nBy executing these strategies, Quinn can effectively maintain an advantage over Gnar.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high mobility and ranged attacks in the early game, making it easier to pressure Gnar. In particular, Yasuo's Q is excellent for wave clearing and harassment, which can diminish Gnar's ability to maintain his lane. Additionally, since all of Yasuo's skills can be used at no cost, he can deal sustained damage easily and create advantageous situations before Gnar can grow.\n\nTo take advantage, you should harass Gnar with Q between levels 1 and 5 while securing CS by clearing minions. It's important to use E to create distance and avoid Gnar's W (Wither). Furthermore, saving Wind Wall can help block Gnar's E and support from the enemy jungle. After level 6, you can aim for kills using knock-ups and expand your lead by roaming. Proper wave management is also effective; pushing deep to apply pressure and prevent Gnar from safely stacking Q is crucial.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has high short-term damage, and especially after level 6, she can overwhelm Gnar with her burst damage. Camille's passive shield and high burst damage are very effective against Gnar in his mini form before he transforms. Additionally, Camille has a long-range blink, making it easier for her to approach while avoiding Gnar's crowd control, allowing her to gain an advantage in trades.\n\nTo take advantage, you should repeatedly engage in short trades between levels 1 and 5 to prevent Gnar from stacking his Q. It's important for Camille to conserve her shield with Q while using E to set up ambushes with the wall. Once you reach level 6, you can use W to immobilize Gnar and finish him off with burst damage. Also, managing vision while roaming in side lanes and destroying towers is crucial to securing an overall advantage in the game.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed has high sustained damage and can deal powerful DPS, especially against melee champions. When Na is in mini form, his attack power is low, making it difficult for him to counter Singed's continuous poison damage, creating a situation where Singed can fight advantageously. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed and can use slows and immobilization to restrict Na's movement, making it easier for him to engage and attack.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively attack when Na is in mini form and deal damage. Specifically, be careful not to take Na's normal attacks three times in a row, as avoiding the magic damage from his passive that activates on the third attack is crucial. Avoid pushing the lane too much and farm moderately to prevent Na from freezing under the tower.\n\nAlso, building armor and HP early can make it harder for Na to push you out of the lane. Rushing to create a Sunfire Cape and choosing Ninja Tabi can also effectively increase your durability. After level 6, there may be opportunities to all-in when Na is in mega form in the lane, so consider using your teleport to apply map pressure. By utilizing these strategies, you can progress the matchup against Na favorably.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and can easily absorb Gnar's attacks. Gnar has low base stats in mini form and is weak to all-ins, making it difficult for him to counter Sion's durability. Additionally, Sion has multiple crowd control skills, and his R's charge and knock-up serve as powerful engagement tools against Gnar. Furthermore, Sion has a passive that allows him to continue contributing to fights for a certain period after death.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize CS in the early game while avoiding Gnar's attacks and farming. It's important to use Sion's skills to pressure Gnar and disrupt his farming. In the mid-game, take on the role of frontline in team fights to protect allies. By using R to pull in enemies and increase ally damage, you can turn fights in your favor. Also, be mindful of Gnar's transformation and engage at the right timing.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick has high early damage and can secure lane dominance by actively attacking Nasus. It is particularly important to use Yorick's \"Graves\" to chip away at health to prevent Nasus from using \"Siphon.\" Additionally, Yorick has the ability to summon pets, which allows him to apply pressure on Nasus through sheer numbers. Furthermore, Yorick has high base stats, making him durable and able to withstand Nasus's attacks more easily.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to manage minions well during the laning phase and create situations where Nasus cannot use \"Siphon.\" By utilizing Yorick's \"Minions,\" you can continuously apply pressure on Nasus to prevent him from growing. It is also necessary to be mindful of Nasus's \"Wisp\" and to avoid his skills. In terms of item build, prioritize items that increase durability while also selecting items that boost attack power to enhance damage. Finally, in team fights, utilize Yorick's \"Ultimate\" to target Nasus when he is isolated, allowing for a more advantageous fight.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Olaf is strong in early skirmishes and can actively trade against Gnar, especially between levels 1 and 3. In Gnar's mini form, his base stats are low, making him susceptible to damage from Olaf's attacks. Additionally, after applying a slow with Olaf's Q, he can create an even more advantageous situation by chasing. Furthermore, Olaf's R allows him to negate crowd control, enabling him to attack while avoiding Gnar's powerful CC in mega form.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively trade between levels 1 and 3 to chip away at Gnar's HP. If Gnar is pushing minions, use the bushes to approach from the side, apply a slow with Q, and then follow up with an auto-attack. Once you reach level 6, using R to negate Gnar's CC and diving in before taking damage from Mega Gnar is effective. Engaging in a prolonged fight allows Olaf's sustain to shine, and stalling in front of the tower is also a strategy to fight advantageously."

      "アーゴット": "Urgot is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick has a W that generates walls, which can limit Urgot's approach. Urgot has a short range, making it difficult to deal with Yorick's Mist Walkers and walls. Additionally, Yorick has high sustain and can fight while healing from Urgot's damage in a 1v1, making it hard for Urgot to gain an advantage. Furthermore, in team fights, Yorick's Maiden is powerful, and Urgot's CC and damage can be easily spread out.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. In the early lane phase, be cautious with harassment and look for opportunities to counterattack when Yorick's W is on cooldown.\n2. Use E to approach and deal damage with Q while positioning carefully to avoid being trapped by Yorick's Mist Walkers.\n3. After level 6, use R to create opportunities to reduce Yorick's HP and prioritize targeting Yorick's Maiden in team fights.\n4. While being wary of ganks, focus on pushing in side lanes to create advantageous situations by isolating Yorick.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that in the early game, Yorick's attack power and pressure are very high. Yorick can push minions while trading favorably with his E, and he can deal sustained damage using his ghouls. Additionally, by creating walls with his W, he can restrict Bloodmire's movement and block escape routes, making it difficult for Bloodmire to avoid attacks. Furthermore, Bloodmire has long cooldowns in the early game and low DPS, making it hard to counter Yorick.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS (creep score) without overextending in the early game and to endure while healing with Q. It is necessary to conserve W (Pool) and time it to dodge Yorick's E and Maiden's attacks. After level 6, utilizing R to deal sustained damage and increase presence in team fights becomes effective, so focusing on leveling up is beneficial. Additionally, purchasing Bramble or heavy armor items can effectively disrupt Yorick's healing.",
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick has high base stats and combat capabilities using his pets, with the Mist Walkers providing particularly strong numerical advantage. Quinn has a shorter range, and when hit by Yorick's E skill, she takes significant damage, making it difficult to approach. Additionally, Yorick's wall-generating skill often restricts Quinn's mobility, leaving her with limited escape options. Furthermore, Yorick's minions are enhanced, making it challenging for Quinn to deal with them. This increases lane pressure, putting Quinn in a disadvantageous situation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid trades in lane and dodge Yorick's skills. Specifically, avoiding his E skill can reduce damage and allow for a focus on dealing with the pets. Additionally, utilizing Quinn's R to roam to other lanes after leaving lane can help secure kills, earn gold, and build items effectively. Furthermore, choosing items like Quicksilver or Guardian Angel can increase her survival rate in fights against Yorick.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick can use minions and the Maiden to gain an advantage in short trades, and especially after level 6, the presence of the Maiden becomes a significant threat. Yorick can block Mundo's escape routes with his W, making it possible to reduce his healing. Additionally, Yorick can use his pets to attack with overwhelming numbers, dealing damage that surpasses Mundo's durability. Furthermore, Mundo lacks crowd control and has no means to counter Yorick's wall, making fights difficult.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forced engagements in the early game and focus on farming minions while poking with Q. If you can force Yorick to use his Maiden before reaching level 6, it creates an opportunity to engage with your ultimate. In terms of items, prioritizing health and durability, and choosing healing-enhancing or tank items can help you sustain in prolonged fights. Additionally, utilizing ally ganks to chip away at Yorick's Maiden can help you gain an advantage.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick's E skill summons a pet (Mistwalker), and when it takes damage from Mordekaiser's attacks, his combat ability is significantly reduced. Additionally, by using Yorick's ultimate, Mordekaiser is forced into a one-on-one situation, which becomes very troublesome if Yorick's \"Maiden\" is present. Furthermore, Yorick can use walls to restrict Mordekaiser's movement, making it difficult for him to engage. Mordekaiser is a champion that relies on close combat, and he struggles against highly mobile opponents, putting him at a disadvantage against someone like Yorick.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid Yorick's E. If it hits, Yorick's ghost will attack, so dodging it can help turn the fight in your favor. Additionally, enduring until level 6 and fighting after Yorick has used his ultimate can weaken his strength. Having early armor to increase durability when taking Yorick's attacks is also effective. Moreover, farming minions to gain experience while disrupting Yorick's farm will be key to suppressing his growth and achieving victory.",
      "シンジド": "Singed is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick's Mistwalkers and Maiden provide high sustain in prolonged fights, making it difficult for Singed's poison to effectively chip away at their sustain. Yorick can use his wall-generating skill to restrict Singed's movement and make it hard for him to engage. Additionally, Singed has no ranged attack options, which poses a risk when trying to approach Yorick. Especially after Yorick summons the Maiden, Singed often finds himself in a situation where he is attacked unilaterally, leading to unfavorable trades.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to look for opportunities when Yorick's Maiden is not present and to chip away at his health with short trades. Additionally, using walls and towers to disrupt Yorick's positioning and interfere with the Maiden's pathing can be effective. Furthermore, in the mid-game, proxy farming can be employed to split resources while regrouping with teammates to participate in team fights, allowing Singed to leverage his strengths.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick's pet (Mistwalker) and wall-generating skills can hinder Darius's attacks. Yorick can use the wall to prevent Darius from approaching and overwhelm him with numbers using the Mistwalker. Additionally, in prolonged fights after using Yorick's R (Maiden), Darius is often susceptible to damage before he can stack his abilities, leading to situations where he cannot deal sustained damage. Furthermore, Yorick has an advantage over juggernaut-type champions who lack mobility, putting Darius at a disadvantage due to this characteristic.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play cautiously from the early game and look for opportunities to push Yorick's minions. By using Q to pull in minions and avoiding short skirmishes, Darius can secure time to stack his abilities. It is also crucial to avoid Yorick's attacks with E, reduce damage with W, and time the use of R for finishing off enemies. In terms of items, prioritizing Black Cleaver and managing HP effectively can enhance durability. In team fights, be aware of Darius's R execution line and avoid engaging recklessly when Yorick's Maiden is present.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that when Yorick reaches level 6, he summons \"The Maiden,\" which has very powerful damage, making it difficult for K'Sante to deal with that attack. Once Yorick takes the lead, he can demonstrate overwhelming combat power alongside his pets, putting K'Sante in an almost invincible state. Additionally, Yorick's wall (E) restricts K'Sante's movement, increasing the likelihood of taking fatal damage if caught. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range, making it hard to avoid Yorick's attacks, especially in team fights and lane battles, leading to unfavorable situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to have Teleport. This allows for easier coordination with teammates and reduces pressure in the lane. When Yorick summons \"The Maiden,\" it is crucial to prioritize dealing with it. Using K'Sante's W to absorb damage while escaping to minions with E can also be effective in avoiding Yorick's attacks. Additionally, on the blue side, using R over the wall can create a one-on-one situation, providing a chance to turn the fight in your favor. Finally, it is important to choose the appropriate items based on Yorick's build and develop strategies according to the situation.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yorick can summon a ghost, which nullifies Gragas's E skill and makes it difficult to escape from his W skill. Additionally, with the Halberd, Yorick has a high ability to apply wave clear and pressure in side lanes, making it hard for Gragas to counter this. Furthermore, Yorick's poke damage is high, and his sustain through lifesteal is excellent, putting Gragas in a disadvantageous position in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid harassment in lane and not to engage when Yorick's ghost is out. Also, using Gragas's Q skill to poke from a distance and managing mana effectively can help maintain lane presence. Moreover, coordinating with support and jungler to gank Yorick can diminish his strengths. In terms of item build, prioritizing items that increase durability and avoiding direct confrontations with Yorick is an effective strategy.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Yorick's high durability and the overwhelming numbers provided by his pets (Mist Walkers). After level 6, Yorick can summon the Maiden, which enhances his strength in prolonged fights. Teemo can neutralize auto-attacks with his blind effect, but the presence of Yorick's skills and pets makes it difficult to deal sustained damage. Additionally, Yorick can use his W to create walls that restrict Teemo's movement and hinder his approach. Furthermore, Teemo has low base durability and is vulnerable in team fights, often putting him at a disadvantage in 1v1s or small skirmishes against Yorick.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following strategies can be considered. First, at the start of the lane, apply blind with Q from behind the minions, poke with E, and freeze the minion wave to prevent Yorick from stepping on his Mist. After level 6, when the Maiden appears, avoid direct confrontations and place mushrooms on approach paths or in bushes to ambush. Also, when Yorick creates a ring with his W, try to evade from the outside and deal damage with mushrooms. As for items, prioritize Bramble Vest and Plated Steelcaps to gain an advantage in trades against Yorick. Coordinating with your jungler to suppress Yorick can also be effective.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that in the early stages, Yorick has an advantage due to his high base stats and attack power using his pets. Yorick can apply pressure with minions and Mist Walkers, pushing Kail under the tower. Kail needs to avoid melee combat until she reaches level 6, and if she takes damage from Yorick, she can easily find herself in a disadvantageous situation. Additionally, Kail lacks hard CC, so her means to counter Yorick's wall are limited. Furthermore, Yorick is also favored in lane trades, especially with his ghost attacks after level 6, which can be a significant threat.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS without overextending in the early game, farming from a distance with Q and AA. Place wards to watch for ganks and maneuver to avoid pressure from Yorick's Mist Walkers. After reaching level 6, it is necessary to engage in short trades using E while ensuring survival with ULT. Additionally, in item builds, balancing AS and AP can enhance damage output while increasing survivability. In team fights, maintaining a position in the backline and avoiding Yorick's attacks is crucial.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Yorick's combat style, which utilizes his pets (Mistwalkers) and walls. After level 6, especially with his ultimate (Maiden), Yorick can exert overwhelming numbers against Aatrox and deal sustained damage. Additionally, when Aatrox's movements are restricted by Yorick's E (Hallowed Mist), it becomes difficult to land attacks. Furthermore, Aatrox has long skill animations, making him susceptible to Yorick's lack of mobility, especially in team fights where dealing with the pets becomes challenging.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to actively engage before level 6 to gain an early lead. Use Ignite to deal early damage and aim to fight when Yorick's pets are not present. It is also effective to ask for help from the jungler to deal with the Maiden early. Additionally, being mindful of dodging E and using your ultimate (Darkin Blade) appropriately can increase your chances of turning the fight in your favor. In team fights, coordinating with strong ranged champions to suppress Yorick will be key to victory."
    },
    "loses": {
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Warwick has high healing capabilities and can deal powerful damage, especially as his HP decreases. While having Yorick's Maiden makes 1v1 unfavorable, before level 6, Warwick can trade while healing with his Q, allowing him to withstand Yorick's attacks and maintain an advantageous position. Additionally, Warwick can restrict the enemy's movement with his E and immobilize them with his R, making it easier to deal with Yorick's pets.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, avoid Yorick's minions while using Q to heal and aim for short trades. In particular, it’s effective to aim for a burst combo with E(Q)→Q when Yorick is distracted by minions. After level 6, if Yorick has his Maiden, it’s important not to force a 1v1 and instead focus on team fights or roaming in side lanes. Creating opportunities to isolate Yorick and leveraging sustain to create advantageous situations is key to victory.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses high mobility and DPS, along with the ability to neutralize Yorick's pets and walls. Yorick relies on his pets and particularly shines in prolonged fights, but Yone excels in short skirmishes and can easily dodge Yorick's skills. Additionally, Yone can attack from a distance with his Q and close the gap with his E, allowing him to deal damage while avoiding Yorick's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be cautious of Yorick's attacks and ghouls in the early game and play defensively. Yone can use a combo of attacking from a distance with his Q and closing the gap with his E to avoid Yorick's W and ghouls while adjusting his positioning. In the mid-game and beyond, he can utilize his ultimate to create pressure in team fights and look for opportunities to attack while neutralizing Yorick's Maiden. Furthermore, by acquiring lifesteal and penetration items early, and aiming for initiations with Flash, Yone can create favorable situations against Yorick.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton has strong trades from level 2, making it easy to engage with his short cooldown skills. While Yorick will attack using his ghost until level 6, Renekton can take advantage of early trades to deal with Yorick's pets more easily, maintaining wave control and establishing an advantage. Additionally, Renekton's healing from his W allows him to withstand Yorick's attacks, enabling him to progress favorably in sustained trades.\n\nTo capitalize on this advantage, Renekton should utilize his level 2 power spike, starting with a longsword and potion to initiate early trades. It's important to dodge Yorick's E, countering with a dash from W to turn the trade in his favor. Furthermore, aiming to break the third wave and push Yorick out of the wave, Renekton can recall early to freeze the wave, creating opportunities to attack when Yorick tries to farm. Renekton should prioritize items like Eclipse or Goredrinker, focusing on damage to apply further pressure on Yorick.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia has a blink ability, allowing her to negate Yorick's wall, making it easier for her to gain an edge in lane trades. Additionally, by using Irelia's E (Transcendent Blades) to land a stun, she can easily deal with Yorick's ghost and utilize the Q reset to deal sustained damage. Furthermore, Irelia has self-healing and damage reduction effects, making her more resilient to Yorick's attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, safely trade while CSing minions with Q. After landing a stun with E, use the combo Q → AA → W, prioritizing the ghost. After level 6, aim for a quick burst before Yorick's Maiden joins the fight, using R to secure an escape route while dealing damage. Additionally, purchasing Mercury's Treads for CC countermeasures and enhancing durability with Blade and Sunfire items can create a more advantageous situation.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has a strong one-on-one capability against Yorick. Fiora's skills allow her to deal additional damage by hitting weak points and heal herself, making it easier to gain the upper hand, especially when Yorick's pets are not present. Additionally, Fiora's W (Riposte) can negate Yorick's important CC and damage, allowing her to parry his attacks while countering. Furthermore, Fiora excels at aiming for quick finishes, and in prolonged fights, she is more susceptible to Yorick's sustain and the influence of his pets, so it's crucial to engage early.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, avoid aggressive plays and farm safely while dodging Yorick's summons. Once in the mid-game, look for opportunities when Yorick's Maiden is absent, aiming for a quick finish by using Q to hit VITALS. During an all-in, use W (Riposte) to limit Yorick's Q and dashes, creating opportunities for counterattacks. Finally, if the Maiden is still present, Fiora should focus on isolating and taking it down, prioritizing fights when Yorick's pets are not around. This way, Fiora can create a favorable situation against Yorick.",
      "サイオン": "Sion has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sion has high durability and AoE damage, making him skilled at engaging in team fights. Yorick is very weak before level 6, allowing Sion to farm and gain an advantage during that time. Additionally, Sion has multiple CC skills, and his R's charge and knock-up are particularly effective against Yorick. He also has a strong ability to deal with Yorick's pet (the Maiden), allowing him to fight favorably in one-on-one situations thanks to his durability.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively farm before level 6 and initiate attacks when Yorick comes out. When hit by Yorick's E, using W to reduce damage and charging Q to counterattack can help you trade favorably in lane. Also, prioritizing the Maiden when she appears is effective in reducing his damage. In team fights, using Sion's R to incapacitate Yorick and focusing on other enemy champions can contribute to the overall victory of the team.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Cho'Gath has powerful crowd control, and by using his W (Silence), he can disrupt Yorick's healing and attacks. Additionally, Cho'Gath has high HP regeneration, making him strong in sustained fights, allowing him to trade favorably against Yorick. Furthermore, after level 6, using his R (Size Increase) increases his durability and makes it easier to body block.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use W to silence Yorick's attacks in the early game while initiating trades with Q (Knock Up). After dealing damage with E (Spike), applying silence with W prevents Yorick's counterattacks. After level 6, utilizing R to increase size and HP enhances his presence in team fights. Also, when Yorick summons the Maiden, immediately retreating or coordinating with the jungle to target the Maiden can help turn the fight in your favor.\n\nFinally, managing the wave properly and freezing it under the tower can effectively lure Yorick out and prompt jungle ganks. This way, you can suppress Yorick's split-pushing while leveraging Cho'Gath's strengths.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has the ability to deal high damage to Yorick. In particular, Gwen's percentage damage and true damage can effectively bypass Yorick's high durability. Additionally, using Gwen's W (Hallowed Mist) makes it easier to avoid Yorick's attacks, increasing her survivability in both team fights and one-on-one situations. Furthermore, Gwen can use her E (Slow effect) to limit Yorick's movements, increasing her opportunities to attack.\n\nTo take advantage, prioritize acquiring W first to prepare for Yorick's minion-throwing attacks. Next, it's important to save E for the moment Yorick uses his cage, restricting his movements. By attacking after gaining passive from minions, you can maximize damage and gain an advantage over Yorick. Also, be mindful of applying pressure in the side lane, and if Yorick is in the jungle, actively pushing to reduce his influence can be effective.",
      "セト": "Sett has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett can apply kill pressure on Yorick before reaching level 6, especially making it easier to gain an advantage before Yorick's pet, the Maiden, comes out. Sett's shield from his W and enhanced attacks from his Q allow him to deal consistent damage while taking hits from Yorick, making him strong in long trades. Additionally, Sett has CC skills, which makes it easier to catch Yorick and turn fights in his favor.\n\nTo take advantage, first, actively attack Yorick before reaching level 6 and manage experience by stealing his minions. Particularly, if you can avoid Yorick's E, the fights become easier. Sett's tower dives are also effective, especially when Yorick has no Flash. After level 6, it's important to either rely on your jungler for ganks or farm safely during dragon fights to suppress Yorick's strength while focusing on your own growth.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn has high durability and versatile crowd control, allowing him to gain an edge in team fights and lane trades. Yorick relies on his pets, so by prioritizing attacks on his pet (the Maiden), Ornn can significantly diminish Yorick's combat effectiveness. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at maintaining his lane and easier to prevent Yorick from attacking towers.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to be cautious of an all-in at early levels 2/3 and to avoid Yorick's E. Deal damage with Ornn's Q while using W to create a wall, restricting Yorick's movement. Use E to get close to Yorick and look for opportunities to counterattack. By prioritizing attacks on Yorick's Maiden, you can halve his strength. Ultimately, the goal is to use Ornn's R to engage in team fights and neutralize Yorick.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille possesses high mobility and burst damage, allowing her to effectively deal with Yorick's pets, the Mist Walkers, and the Maiden from her ultimate. Camille's Q deals single-target damage, enabling her to quickly eliminate Yorick's ghost. Additionally, by utilizing Camille's E for a blink, she can attack while avoiding Yorick's wall, thereby neutralizing his skills.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to target moments when Yorick's ultimate is not active. During the cooldown of his ultimate, you can actively engage in trades, dealing damage with Q while using E to escape or chase, thus gaining the upper hand. Moreover, disrupting CS to prevent Yorick's ghost from appearing is effective, and if the ghost does spawn, avoiding AoE skills and eliminating it with single-target attacks is beneficial. Furthermore, frequently sidestepping to avoid Yorick's E and timing your attacks can create a more advantageous situation.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels in long-range combat, particularly with effective harassment using his barrels (E). While Yorick has strong durability in close combat, he is vulnerable to Gangplank's long-range skills in the early game. Additionally, Gangplank can fight while avoiding Yorick's ghost and wall (E), allowing him to deal damage while maintaining distance. Furthermore, Gangplank's ultimate has a significant impact in team fights and makes it easy to assist other lanes.\n\nTo take advantage, first, maintain the wave closer to the center from the start to prevent Yorick from building up his ghost. Use barrels (E) from level 1 to harass with Q while keeping your distance to avoid entering Yorick's attack range. From levels 3 to 6, be cautious of Yorick's short-term power spikes, and it's important to deal damage with barrel chains while forcing him to use his healing skills and potions. After level 6, it becomes difficult to win a 1v1 when Yorick has his maiden, so avoid direct confrontations and use your ultimate to support side lanes or team fights. When Yorick starts to split push, respond with teleport or allies, and avoid chasing him alone.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is favored.\n\nNasus is extremely powerful in the late game, and his damage scales infinitely as he stacks his Q. Yorick is a champion that applies pressure in the early game, but since Nasus is weak early on, it is important not to force a counterattack when Yorick is aggressive, and instead manage the minions while safely stacking his Q. Additionally, Nasus's W slow can hinder Yorick's approach, especially against Yorick's ghost and Mist Walkers.\n\nTo gain an advantage, it is crucial to avoid unnecessary attacks in the early game, handle minions while maintaining a freeze near the tower, and stack Q. Save Wither for when Yorick approaches or for his ghost, using it at the right moment to limit Yorick's attacks. In the mid-game and beyond, if Nasus has farmed well, he can become more aggressive against Yorick. Particularly after Nasus has grown, he can utilize his durability in split-pushing and team fights to counter Yorick effectively.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has powerful poke from a distance, making it easy to deal damage to Yorick with Shock Blast (Q), especially in the early game. Yorick is vulnerable to early ranged attacks, and when he takes damage from Jayce, it becomes difficult for him to maintain his minion shield. Additionally, Jayce can use Acceleration Gate (W) to quickly create distance, allowing him to avoid Yorick's attacks while engaging in favorable trades.\n\nTo take advantage, Jayce should poke Yorick with Shock Blast (Q) while maintaining distance between levels 1 and 3, limiting Yorick's ability to use minions to maintain his shield. From levels 4 to 5, he can use Acceleration Gate (W) for short trades while being cautious of Yorick's counterattacks and managing the minions. After level 6, as Yorick's Maiden (R) becomes powerful, Jayce should focus on roaming and fighting under towers, employing a strategy of maintaining distance while taking down side lanes in team fights. In terms of items, purchasing armor (like plating) early on increases durability, making it easier to withstand Yorick's attacks."

    "beats": {
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and DPS, and especially when his items are completed, he exhibits a powerful power spike. While Sion has high durability, his skill activation is slow, making it difficult to land attacks on the highly mobile Yone. Additionally, against Yone's auto-attack-based damage, Sion cannot leverage his tankiness effectively, and he takes significant damage, especially from Yone's critical hits. Furthermore, Yone has crowd control, making it easy for him to cancel Sion's skills and causing Sion to lose his advantage in fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to be creative with the item build. Purchasing Thornmail early can help reduce Yone's damage. Additionally, combining Jackshow and Gargoyle can increase durability, allowing Sion to withstand Yone's attacks. In fights, it is effective to look for opportunities to attack after Yone uses his W and to create distance using E. Moreover, focusing on pushing in the side lanes and avoiding 1v1s with Yone can help suppress his growth. Utilizing minions to accelerate the push and advance the lane advantage is also crucial.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and burst damage, allowing him to gain an advantage, especially in 1v1 trades. To avoid Yorick's CC (W), Yone can use his E to close the distance or dodge, making it difficult for Yorick's crowd control to be effective. Additionally, Yone focuses on critical hit damage, which makes him good at whittling down Yorick's durability. Furthermore, Yorick relies on his pets, so when they are not available, his combat ability decreases, putting him at a disadvantage against Yone.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, prioritize minion farming in the early game, marking with E and healing with Q to maintain lane presence. By predicting Yone's E and placing W, you can limit his attacks. Also, after level 6, it is important to conserve the Maiden and aim for kills or splits, avoiding 1v1s with Yone while enhancing the overall team strength. Additionally, securing vision and being cautious of Yone's roaming can help reduce his influence.",
      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Yone's high mobility and burst damage. Yone can deal significant damage in a short period using his skills, and he can easily approach Cho'Gath with his E ability. Additionally, Yone's skills focus on critical hits, making him effective at whittling down Cho'Gath's durability. Furthermore, if Yone can avoid Cho'Gath's Q (Rupture) and W (Feral Scream), Cho'Gath becomes more vulnerable to Yone's attacks. In the laning phase, Yone can gain an advantage by using his Q to wear down Cho'Gath and then engaging when he returns with his E.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it is important to prioritize minions and use Q to disrupt Yone's E. Avoid short trades and maintain safety by taking damage under the minion wave. Additionally, after level 6, utilizing R to aim for kills and stopping Yone's engage can be effective, so coordinating with teammates to take the frontline is beneficial. Moreover, prioritizing tank items to increase durability is also crucial to withstand Yone's attacks.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and burst damage, with his E's dash and R's damage being particularly threatening. Rumble struggles with managing his heat gauge, and if he overheats, he becomes silenced, making it difficult to retaliate against Yone's attacks. Additionally, Rumble's only crowd control is a slow, which limits his escape options against Yone's auto-attack-based aggression, making him vulnerable. Furthermore, Yone has strong wave-pushing power, which makes it hard for Rumble to secure CS while harassing, as he ends up damaging the minions.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, in the early lane phase, it's important to use E to push the wave while harassing with Q, paying attention to Yone's E. When Yone dashes in with his E, using W for a shield and creating distance can help reduce damage. After level 6, using R to predict Yone's dash and placing it ahead can zone him and secure an advantage in team fights. Additionally, maintaining vision and being cautious of Yone's side roam can limit his movements and help Rumble progress the lane favorably.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high burst damage, and especially after level 6, he can quickly whittle down Mundo with his R combo. Yone's E dash and Q damage pose a threat to Mundo's durability. Additionally, Yone has short cooldowns on his skills, allowing him to deal consistent damage and making it difficult for Mundo to find opportunities to heal. Furthermore, while Yone is item-dependent, he has a strong power spike from early to mid-game, which could create an advantageous situation before Mundo can properly equip himself.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary trades in the early game and focus on farming CS with Q while securing minions. Use W at the right timing to dodge Yone's E and R, and try to avoid taking damage. In terms of itemization, purchasing items like Bramble Vest and Thornmail early to increase durability is effective. Additionally, strengthening coordination with the jungle and ensuring vision to avoid ganks while focusing on winning side lanes is crucial.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and DPS, giving him an advantage, especially in lane trades. Yone's Q deals high damage, and he can dodge Gwen's attacks with his E dash, making it difficult for Gwen to land her hits. Additionally, Yone has CC abilities that can restrict Gwen's movement, making her particularly vulnerable in team fights and 1v1 scenarios. Furthermore, Gwen has a short range, often putting her in situations where she is susceptible to Yone's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid trades during the laning phase and to attack when Yone's Q is on cooldown. Choosing Lethal Tempo and aiming for short trades can help Gwen fight more favorably. In terms of item build, prioritizing Armor boots and Nashor's Tooth, as well as considering a tank build to reduce physical damage, would be beneficial. Additionally, actively engaging when Yone's E is on cooldown can help gain an advantage in trades.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is Yone's high mobility and DPS. Yone is an auto-attack-based champion who can deal significant damage using his skills. In particular, while Yone's E has a long cooldown, if used correctly, it can avoid Mordekaiser's attacks and allow for follow-ups with Q and R. Additionally, Yone has strong pushing power in lane, enabling him to deal damage before Mordekaiser can get close, making it difficult for Mordekaiser from the early game.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it's important to be creative with item builds, acquiring items like Riftmaker and Steelcaps early to increase durability while dealing damage. In lane, predicting Yone's trading patterns and looking for opportunities to land E + Q is effective. Especially between levels 1-5, Yone is weaker, so it's advisable to engage in aggressive trades when you have a shield. Furthermore, after obtaining Zhonya's Hourglass, using the active ability can help you avoid Yone's attacks more easily, so timing its use is crucial.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Yone has high mobility and DPS, allowing him to engage in powerful trades, especially against Ornn, who relies heavily on auto-attacks. Yone's Q (Slice) and E (Lunge) combo can avoid Ornn's CC, making it likely that he can deal damage before Ornn lands his skills. Additionally, Yone has armor penetration, making it easier to reduce Ornn's durability as a tank. Furthermore, Ornn has low mobility and is often put in situations where he is vulnerable to Yone's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points:  \n1. Avoid trading in lane and focus on baiting out Yone's skills before counterattacking. Specifically, attacking after Yone misses his Q3 can help turn trades in your favor.  \n2. Be creative with your item build and prioritize armor early to reduce Yone's damage. Purchasing Chain Mail or Ninja Tabi early can be effective in increasing your durability.  \n3. When Yone pushes, ensure you secure experience without losing minions to avoid falling behind in levels.  \n4. Seeking help from the jungler can apply pressure on Yone, increasing Ornn's chances to play favorably.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, Ornn can alleviate his disadvantage against Yone and maintain his lane.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and burst damage, and especially in levels 1-3, Yone's Q and E poke is very strong. K'Sante has a short range and is susceptible to Yone's attacks, making it easy to fall behind in early trades. Additionally, it is difficult for K'Sante to land CC against Yone's E dash, often missing opportunities for counterattacks. Furthermore, Yone's burst damage from his R poses a threat to K'Sante's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, during levels 1-3, it is crucial not to force trades and to focus on minion management to avoid Yone's attacks. Next, after level 3, it is necessary to use CC to time when to interrupt Yone's E and create opportunities for counterattacks. In terms of items, prioritizing armor and HP, as well as having anti-healing items (like Bramble Vest), can enhance sustain and help K'Sante trade more favorably against Yone. Finally, it is important to be mindful of wave management and to remain vigilant against roaming and jungle interventions.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and DPS, which particularly exploits Kail's early weakness during the laning phase. Kail is in a very tough situation as a melee champion until she reaches level 6, making her susceptible to Yone's attacks, especially vulnerable to auto-attack-based damage. Additionally, Yone's CC skills restrict Kail's movement, making it difficult for her to escape. Furthermore, Yone has strong hitbox detection for his skills, allowing him to effectively maneuver against Kail's slow-effect skills.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to manage the minion wave to avoid harassment in lane and to prevent taking damage from Yone. Specifically, timing the avoidance of Yone's third Q and E by playing passively can help evade his attacks. As for item selection, purchasing Seeker's Armguard early to increase durability is effective. After reaching level 6, utilizing her R to create an invulnerable state is crucial for dodging Yone's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack. Fighting while maintaining distance can reduce the risk of taking damage from Yone.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone has high mobility and DPS, and especially in the early lane phase, Yone's Q (Slice) provides strong poke. Yone can reduce damage using W (Shield) while creating distance with E (Dash), making it difficult for Yasuo to engage. Additionally, Yone's R (Blade of the Heavens) is often used simultaneously with Yasuo's R (Last Breath), turning it into a timing battle that allows Yone to gain the upper hand. Furthermore, while Yone is item-dependent, he can secure an advantage through early trades, forcing Yasuo to play defensively.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to force engagements early on and to farm safely using minions. Yasuo should be cautious of Yone's Q and E while conserving W (Wind Wall) to block poke and avoid the opponent's skills. After level 6, it is crucial to time actions carefully to avoid Yone's R and to coordinate with teammates. As for items, purchasing PD (Phantom Dancer) and MR (Magic Resist) early can enhance survivability, allowing Yasuo to trade more favorably against Yone."

    "loses": {
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia is strong in both burst and sustained combat, particularly with her ability to deflect Yone's attacks. Irelia's E has a stun effect, allowing her to temporarily neutralize Yone's attacks, making it easier to create opportunities for counterattacks when Yone engages. Additionally, Irelia has a blink ability, enabling her to approach and deal damage while avoiding Yone's skills. Furthermore, Irelia has sustain, allowing her to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to prioritize CS at the start and avoid Yone's Q poke. Between levels 2 and 5, use minions to aim for stuns with E and exchange damage with short combos. Since prolonged fights can be disadvantageous, it is crucial to retreat after dealing damage early. After level 6, check Yone's E and R cooldowns, and engage when they are on cooldown to fight advantageously. Also, during roams and team fights, focus on entering from the side to chip away at Yone's sustain.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Riven is strong in damage trades from the early game, especially because she can aim for a quick finish by level 3. By spamming Riven's Q, stunning with W, and then using E for a shield, she can deal high burst damage to Yone. Additionally, Riven has plenty of mobility, making it easier to dodge Yone's skills, particularly by engaging after he uses his E or R.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to push the minions early and time your attacks when Yone's E is on cooldown. Riven has no skill costs, allowing her to harass continuously while avoiding Yone's skills. Also, by quickly building Black Cleaver, she can prepare for extended fights while increasing her damage. Furthermore, using wards to watch for jungle interventions and leveraging Riven's strengths to create an advantageous situation early on is key to victory.",
      "セト": "Sett has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett has sustained HP recovery abilities and strong shields, making him strong in prolonged fights. While Yone has high DPS, he is highly item-dependent and struggles to counter Sett's durability until he is fully equipped. Additionally, Sett's W shield and AA enhancement allow him to deflect Yone's attacks while providing opportunities to counterattack. Furthermore, Sett's E is very effective as a means to catch Yone, making it easier to force trades.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to be aggressive from level 1 and put pressure on Yone. Using sidesteps to avoid Yone's Q and baiting his skills is also effective. After Yone uses his E, approach his soul to land an E stun, then use W to counterattack. Additionally, right-clicking your feet before Yone uses his ultimate increases the chances of dodging it. The item build should progress in the order of Stridebreaker → Trinity Force → Cleaver → Bloodmain, and selecting boots according to the situation can further enhance your advantage.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton has high sustain and strong trading capabilities. In particular, Renekton's W has a shield-breaking effect, allowing him to negate Yone's shield and gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, Renekton can utilize Fury to enhance his skills and execute combos with short cooldowns, enabling him to apply continuous pressure on Yone.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important not to approach Yone at level 1. Since Fury is needed, it is better to initiate trades after level 3. Especially, trading after using the enhanced W to break Yone's shield makes it easier to deal damage. Furthermore, using E to limit Yone's movement and prevent extended fights is also effective. In terms of item build, prioritizing Phage and focusing on breaking shields in short trades can further enhance your advantage in fights.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Anbessa has a dash attached to all of his skills, making it easier to avoid Yone's attacks by utilizing his high mobility. In particular, by using the dash while being cautious of Yone's Q and E, he can evade Yone's attacks while creating opportunities for counterattacks. Additionally, Anbessa's short-term damage output is significant, making him well-suited for whittling down Yone's HP. Furthermore, Anbessa's R provides suppression, which effectively limits Yone's movements and can shut down carries in team fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to safely handle minions while charging the passive in the early game, and to avoid Yone's three-hit Q with the dash. In the mid-game, look for opportunities when Yone's E returns, and approach to layer slows with Q and E for favorable trades. In the late game, utilize heals and shields, and when Yone steps forward, suppress him with R to secure kills. Particularly, chasing after Yone uses his E allows for attacks that leverage Anbessa's dash.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is strong in short trades, especially by attacking while avoiding Yone's skills. Yone is powerful in levels 1-3, but Jax can use his E defensively to parry Yone's attacks and aim for counterattacks. Additionally, Jax has a strong power spike after acquiring the Trinity Force, and his skills enhance his auto-attacks, allowing him to deal sustained damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to avoid Yone's Q first. During trades, it's important to attack briefly and then back off quickly to minimize damage while forcing Yone to waste his skills. Particularly after Yone uses his E, it’s a good opportunity to counterattack, so timing your aggression then is advisable. Moreover, Jax should prioritize farming while safely aiming for the Trinity Force. This will ensure his strength in the late game and create a favorable situation against Yone.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen can utilize his tank characteristics to absorb Yone's burst damage. By using Shen's E (Taunt), he can stop Yone's attacks, and in short trades, Shen's durability works to his advantage. Additionally, Shen's W can negate Yone's normal attacks and some burst damage, reducing the risk of taking damage from Yone.\n\nTo take advantage, you can freeze the minion wave early in the lane and poke Yone with Q while keeping him at bay. When Yone approaches, you can use E to stop his actions and retaliate with W, allowing you to deal damage while staying alive. Furthermore, using R to save allies can enhance the overall combat power of the team. In team fights, it is important to use R to stand firm in the frontline, absorbing Yone's attacks while supporting your teammates.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce has long-range poke capabilities and can safely deal damage to Yone using Q (Shock Blast) and W (Hammer). While Yone has high mobility, Jayce can attack from a distance, forcing Yone to use his E (Dash), and then follow up with a short burst using Hammer form. Additionally, Jayce's harassment in the early lane is strong, allowing him to create advantageous situations before Yone gets his items.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane, always maintain distance while poking with Q and aim for bursts with W. After Yone uses his E, he has reduced mobility, so at that moment, switch to Hammer form to deal short-term damage. It's important to be cautious not to push the minions too much and maintain positioning to avoid being engaged by Yone's E. After level 6, while being mindful of Yone's R (Chase), continue to poke to create advantageous situations in team fights and roams.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora's W (Riposte) can negate Yone's CC skills, making it a powerful counter against Yone's Q2 (knock-up) and R (movement impairment). Fiora can deal high damage in one-on-one combat, allowing her to parry Yone's attacks while dealing significant damage in return. Additionally, Fiora has strong percentage damage against tank champions, enabling her to efficiently chip away at Yone's HP.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning of the lane, prioritize CS (creep score) without forcing attacks. It is crucial to avoid Yone's Q2 knock-up. If you successfully parry with W at the moment Yone approaches with E or during the motion of Q2/R, immediately execute a combo (Q→AA→R) to target Vital. Hitting W from a distance is difficult, so it's advisable to use bushes or minions to set up ambushes. After level 6, isolate yourself and split-push, using R to impair movement and aim for guaranteed kills on Vital. Be cautious, as if Yone creates distance with E, it can become disadvantageous, so it's important to avoid running out of W and to be mindful of side rotations.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremdamer is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Tremdamer has high single-target damage and healing capabilities, and especially with his R (Undying Rage), he can fight without dying at least once, allowing him to aggressively aim for kills in a 1v1 against Yone. Additionally, Tremdamer has strong split-pushing abilities and excellent lane sustain, making it easier to apply pressure on Yone.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to manage minions in the lane while being cautious of Yone's third Q (knock-up) and closing the distance with E. In short skirmishes, use Q to secure healing and consider R as a crucial one-time use. Furthermore, by chasing with E in response to Yone's E (disengage), you can continue to apply pressure through side-pushing. This way, you can suppress Yone's healing in prolonged fights while leveraging Tremdamer's strengths.",
      "アカリ": "Akali has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Akali possesses high mobility and burst damage, particularly excelling in short trades. Yone is highly item-dependent and tends to struggle against Akali until he is fully equipped. Additionally, Akali's smoke screen obscures vision, making it difficult for Yone to use his skills, especially allowing her to avoid damage from his Q's passive. Furthermore, Akali's trades at level 3 are powerful, and using Ignite allows her to aim for early kills.\n\nTo take advantage, first, aggressively engage at level 3, dealing damage with Q and auto-attacks, and utilize Ignite to aim for an early kill. After Yone uses his E, it is crucial to close the distance with Akali's E1 and aim for the final hit with Q. If Yone is pushing, requesting a gank from the jungler and coordinating to secure a kill is also effective. In prolonged fights, Yone gains the upper hand, so it is essential to focus on short trades and maintain an aggressive playstyle.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille has short burst damage, which is particularly effective against single targets. Against Yone, Camille can use her E (Hookshot) to close the gap and deal instant damage with her Q (Blade Dance). Additionally, Camille's W (Defensive) shield can absorb Yone's critical hits, allowing her to gain an advantage in trades. Furthermore, by using Camille's R (Divide), she can isolate Yone and eliminate him quickly, making her especially strong after level 6.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to manipulate the minions in the early lane phase to make it difficult for Yone to land his Q (Slice). Aim for short trades and unleash Camille's E→Q combo for burst damage. It's wise to save W and be prepared for Yone's counterattacks. Once you reach level 6, using R to isolate Yone and secure a kill before any ally intervention is ideal. Additionally, utilizing roams and tower pressure to widen the gap before losing in scaling is key to maximizing Camille's strengths.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in long trades and can deal sustained damage with his passive. While Yone has high mobility, he is vulnerable to Darius's powerful attacks when caught in close range, especially when pulled in by Darius's E, which increases the risk of taking damage. Additionally, Darius's R becomes available again after securing a kill, making it easier to aim for multi-kills in team fights or one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use Q while positioning between minions and apply pressure with auto-attacks in the early game. When Yone engages with his E, you can pull him back with your E and stack bleed with W and auto-attacks to deal damage. Once you reach level 6, look for opportunities to use your R to secure kills while being mindful of jungle coordination. Furthermore, attacking when Yone's E cooldown or sustain is down can create even more advantageous situations.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing capabilities, making him good at lane maintenance. In particular, Garen's Q (Decisive Strike) has a silence effect that can prevent Yone from using his skills, making it difficult for Yone to attack with his abilities. Additionally, Garen's R (Demacian Justice) deals true damage, allowing him to inflict significant damage while ignoring Yone's durability.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to start trading at level 1 using auto-attacks (AA) and Q to chip away at the opponent's HP. Aim to level up first at level 2 and use Q and E to bring the opponent's HP down to half. When Yone uses Q on minions, counterattack with Garen's Q and aggressively push during E's cooldown. After level 6, after reducing Yone's HP to half, aim for an all-in using Q, E, Ignite, and R while avoiding Yone's counterattacks, which is key to victory.\n\nIn terms of item selection, building Warden's Mail to reduce damage and purchasing Executioner's Calling early can create a favorable situation against Yone. By utilizing these strategies, Garen can effectively gain the upper hand against Yone."

  "ボリベア": {
    "name": "ボリベア",
    "beats": {
      "イレリア": "Irelia is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that the stun effect from Volibear's main skill, E, is very powerful, and Irelia is weak against crowd control, making her susceptible to Volibear's attacks. Additionally, Volibear often opts for a tank build, which makes it difficult for Irelia to deal damage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Volibear's attack speed buff and high dueling performance make it hard for Irelia to gain an advantage in trades. Especially when Volibear has PTA, early trades become very tough.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to purchase anti-heal items (Executioner's Calling) early. Bringing Ignite can help suppress Volibear's healing. Trades should be kept short, and it is necessary to either avoid E or block it with W, considering Volibear's W cooldown. After level 6, if you can dodge Volibear's R with Flash or W, your chances of turning the fight in your favor increase. Collaborating with the jungle can also make it easier to take down Volibear, so actively coordinating with your jungler is effective.",
      "トランドル": "Trundle is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear has high combat power from the early game, especially after level 3, where his ganks and all-ins are very strong. With Volibear's Q dealing damage and providing a stun effect, Trundle may take significant damage before he can close the gap. Additionally, Volibear's passive allows him to deal sustained damage, making it difficult for Trundle to gain an advantage in one-on-one situations. Furthermore, Volibear excels at tower diving, which can put Trundle in a disadvantageous position when trying to defend under the tower.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to consider the following points. First, safely clear the wave in the early game and make sure to ward to track Volibear's movements as you aim for level 3, avoiding ganks. Also, take advantage of Volibear's Q and W cooldowns to disrupt his chase with your E, aiming to gain an advantage in one-on-one fights. Additionally, utilizing Trundle's R to steal Volibear's defenses can help you turn the tide in prolonged engagements. Finally, it is crucial to build your items and maintain your HP while pushing the lane to enhance your ability to counter Volibear.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear is strong in close-range fights, especially due to his high attack power and durability from the early game. Volibear can initiate short combos at levels 2-3, so Yasuo needs to avoid unnecessary confrontations. Additionally, Volibear's healing abilities and stun effects give him high sustainability in prolonged fights, reducing Yasuo's opportunities to utilize his burst damage. Furthermore, since Volibear's main skills have short range, Yasuo, who has limited means of closing the gap, becomes more susceptible to Volibear's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary confrontations in the early game and to manage distance by repeatedly using E to execute short Qs through minions. Around level 6, be cautious of Volibear's charges and healing abilities, while using W to block long-range attacks and looking for opportunities to knock up with Tornado. Additionally, preparing early anti-healing measures like Grievous Wounds can effectively suppress Volibear's healing.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear is strong in early skirmishes and has high burst damage, making it likely that he can deal damage before Warwick can engage. Additionally, Volibear's CC (stun) makes it difficult for Warwick to utilize his healing abilities. Furthermore, Volibear excels at tower diving, making it hard for Warwick to establish an advantage in lane. While Warwick is strong in sustained fights, he is vulnerable to Volibear's burst damage and CC.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to avoid aggressive ganks at levels 2 and 3 and to maneuver in a way that avoids Volibear's attacks. Securing vision and keeping track of Volibear's movements can help avoid unnecessary 1v1 situations. Additionally, refraining from harassment in lane and dodging Volibear's attacks with E while aiming to heal with W can be effective. Moreover, conserving R and using it when Volibear overextends under the tower or at key moments in team fights can create opportunities for a comeback.",
      "セト": "Sett is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear is a strong hard counter to Sett, especially in the laning phase where Volibear's damage and CC (crowd control) capabilities pose significant challenges for Sett. Volibear's main skill, the stun effect from his W, hinders Sett's approach and takes away his advantage in trades. Additionally, Volibear can push and clear camps quickly from the early game, making it easier for him to dominate the lane. Furthermore, Volibear's passive provides sustained damage, which is a threat to Sett.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n\n1. Rush anti-heal: It's important to equip Bramble Vest or Executioner's Calling to suppress Volibear's healing.\n2. Prioritize Black Cleaver: Equip Black Cleaver before Volibear gets Iceborn Gauntlet or Frozen Heart to increase your damage.\n3. Constantly push the lane: Continuously pushing the lane can prevent Volibear from diving after he reaches level 6. Early level ambushes can also be effective.\n4. Avoid Ignite: Use Teleport or Ghost to leave the lane and contribute to the team, thereby avoiding one-on-one confrontations with Volibear.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate Sett's disadvantage and create a more favorable situation.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear has powerful CC (unmovable stun) from the early game, allowing him to gain an advantage in short trades. Volibear can aggressively engage from level 1, and since Tryndamere has limited means to avoid that CC, it becomes difficult for him to farm and maintain his lane in the early game. Additionally, Volibear's skills deal high damage with low cooldowns, making it likely that he can apply pressure before Tryndamere can scale.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Between levels 1 and 3, it is important to prioritize farming minions and avoid direct trades with Volibear. Focus on healing with Q while poking and retreating.\n2. Use wards to control the sides and keep track of Volibear's movements, which can help avoid ganks and engagements.\n3. After level 6, be mindful of avoiding Volibear's CC and either use R to survive forcefully or look for opportunities to burst him down.\n4. In terms of items, prioritize attack speed and critical strike to increase damage output early, allowing you to counter Volibear effectively.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear is strong in early short trades, especially by getting close and landing a stun, which allows him to gain an advantage over Mundo. Volibear's Q and E attacks can deal damage that exceeds Mundo's sustain healing, making it difficult for Mundo to utilize his healing effectively, especially in the early game. Additionally, Volibear excels at tower diving, creating unfavorable situations for Mundo when fighting under the tower.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important not to engage in close combat early on, instead farming with Q while avoiding Volibear's attacks and using sustain healing to endure. Saving potions and aiming to bring the fight into a long-term engagement as levels increase will help leverage Mundo's healing. Furthermore, prioritizing health-focused items in the build and stacking armor to counter Volibear's physical damage is effective. Additionally, it is crucial to time the use of Flash and R to avoid Volibear's crowd control and look for opportunities to counterattack.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the durability and sustain that Volibear possesses. While Pantheon has high burst damage in the early game, Volibear becomes strong in extended fights after level 6 and is also good at tower diving. Since Volibear's main skills have a short range, engaging in an all-in against him carries risks due to his stun and durability. Additionally, Volibear can deal sustained damage in lane, and if Pantheon's skills have long cooldowns, he becomes more susceptible to counterattacks from Volibear.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to place a ward at the start to secure vision and track Volibear's movements. When aiming for a burst at level 2, try not to force trades and focus on avoiding the opponent's skills. Utilizing early roams to impact other lanes and apply pressure on Volibear can also be effective. Furthermore, shifting your build from damage-focused to durability-focused can help prepare for extended fights against Volibear, thereby alleviating the disadvantage in lane.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear is strong in close combat and can gain an advantage, especially in early lane skirmishes. Volibear is a short-range fighter with tank characteristics, possessing both attack and defense. His skills deal high damage and include a stun that immobilizes, making it easy for him to close the gap even if Yone tries to keep his distance. Additionally, Volibear excels at tower diving, making it difficult for Yone to establish an advantage in lane. Furthermore, Yone is highly reliant on items, making it challenging to counter Volibear until he is properly equipped.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Safely poke with Q from the start to create a health difference, making it harder to take damage from Volibear.\n2. After Volibear uses his skills, dodge with E and counterattack to gain an advantage in trades.\n3. Manage the wave to fight under the tower, which can help suppress Volibear's tower diving.\n4. After level 6, conserve R and focus on using it in team fights to avoid direct confrontations with Volibear.\n5. Purchase health and Bramble early to counter Volibear's healing. Flash is essential for summoners, and depending on the situation, consider taking TP or Ignite.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear has strong short-term burst potential from the early game and excels in close combat. Volibear has increased attack speed and high damage from his passive, allowing him to engage before Malphite's armor is fully built, especially as he levels up. Additionally, Malphite only has hard CC with his R to counter Volibear's engage with his R and charges, making it difficult to retaliate before taking damage. Furthermore, Volibear is favored against short-range fighters, and Malphite has limited means to avoid Volibear's attacks, making lane competition tough.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. Build armor items early to reduce Volibear's damage, prioritizing Thornmail and Frozen Heart.\n2. Use Q to poke from a distance and E to reduce Volibear's attack speed, giving you an advantage in trades.\n3. Manage minions effectively in lane to create situations where Volibear has difficulty approaching. Use minions to create walls and avoid Volibear's attacks.\n4. Utilize Flash and sidesteps to avoid Volibear's R and charges, timing your counterattacks carefully.",
      "モルデカイザー": "Mordekaiser is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is the high damage and stun effect from Volibear's E skill, which poses a significant problem. Volibear is strong in close combat and can gain an advantage, especially in brawls. Additionally, Volibear's R skill can block Mordekaiser's ultimate, making it difficult for Mordekaiser to create one-on-one situations. Furthermore, Volibear has strong traits against short-range fighters, making him a highly mobile opponent who can evade Mordekaiser's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid the damage from Volibear's E skill. By cleverly positioning in the lane and attacking after Volibear uses his E, you can reduce the damage taken. It is also important to utilize Mordekaiser's passive to deal sustained damage while maneuvering to avoid Volibear's attacks. Additionally, in terms of item builds, choosing items that increase durability can be effective in allowing you to withstand brawls against Volibear.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear has strong burst damage in short trades between levels 2 and 5. Volibear can engage with his Q, aim for a knock-up with an auto-attack (AA), and deal continuous damage with his W. In contrast, Yorick can create distance with his E and attempt to retaliate with his W, but he can easily find himself in a tough situation if he gets hit by Volibear's attacks. Additionally, after level 6, Volibear can quickly take down the Maiden or look to split push in the side lanes, making it difficult for Yorick to force a long fight.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid pushing the minions too much in the early game to reduce damage taken, and to use E to maintain distance while conserving W. Also, when reaching level 6, summoning the Maiden early and engaging in a long fight with the soldiers can create a favorable situation. Furthermore, by timing the use of W to counter Volibear's engage, you can increase your chances of a successful retaliation.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Volibear is extremely strong in close combat and can gain an advantage, especially in early trades. Volibear is an AA-type fighter and has an advantage against short-range fighters, making it easier for him to hit Anbessa even when Anbessa tries to maintain distance. Additionally, if Anbessa gets hit by Volibear's CC skill, the stun, he loses the opportunity to counterattack and increases the risk of taking damage. Furthermore, Volibear excels at tower diving and tends to be aggressive from the early game, which makes Anbessa feel pressured in the lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered. First, it is important to avoid contact with Volibear in the early game and maintain distance while poking with Q. Utilize the slow from E to ensure an escape route when Volibear approaches. It is also crucial to use W before taking damage to reduce Volibear's attacks. After level 6, using R to suppress Volibear and aiming to dive into the backline during team fights can help reduce Volibear's impact. Securing vision and being cautious of ambushes can also help alleviate the disadvantageous situation."

    "loses": {
      "ナー": "Naut is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Naut has high mobility in mini form, allowing him to harass while avoiding Volibear's attacks. Volibear's main skills have short range, making it difficult for him to close the gap, so Naut can attack while maintaining distance. Additionally, by using Naut's ultimate (R), \"Gnar's Rage,\" he can knock Volibear away, giving him an advantage in team fights.\n\nTo take advantage, Naut should actively harass between levels 1 and 3 while avoiding Volibear's Q (Spike). Once he reaches level 6, he can use his ultimate to chip away at Volibear's health, efficiently farm, and continue to deal damage to Volibear using minions. In team fights, Naut should target the backline, and while Volibear acts as a tank on the frontline, he can knock enemies away to turn the battle in their favor.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has sustained magic damage at close range, and his Q harass is particularly strong. Additionally, by using E, he can limit Volibear's movement and make it difficult for him to engage. Furthermore, Rumble's R provides area damage that can prevent Volibear's charge, increasing his control in team fights and during laning. While Volibear is strong in close combat, Rumble can utilize his sustained damage and crowd control to negate Volibear's strengths.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to use Q and E in the early game to chip away at Volibear's health while pushing the lane. Be mindful of heat to avoid overheating and use skills at the right timing. Once you reach level 6, use R and lay down Equalizer in the path where Volibear is likely to charge, limiting his movement and creating opportunities to counterattack. Additionally, using bushes for ambushes can be effective. In terms of items, purchasing MR and Liandry's early can enhance durability and sustained damage, allowing you to gain an advantage over Volibear.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has an advantage.\n\nThe reason Teemo is advantageous against Volibear is mainly due to his ranged attacks and blind effect. By using Teemo's Q (Blind), he can nullify Volibear's basic attacks, significantly reducing damage in trades. Additionally, Teemo has a longer range, allowing him to engage before Volibear can close the gap, making it easier to establish lane dominance. Furthermore, by using Teemo's R (Mushroom) to secure vision and limit Volibear's movements, it becomes possible to avoid his charges.\n\nTo take advantage, first, from levels 1 to 3, use Q to trade from behind minions, dealing damage to Volibear while maintaining distance. It's also important to place R (Mushrooms) in bushes to secure vision and create escape routes. After level 6, placing mushrooms outside the lane or in the side lanes can help prevent Volibear's charges, allowing for safer play. Additionally, always maintaining distance while conserving Q, and using blind when Volibear approaches can effectively shut down his attacks. This way, Teemo can easily maintain an advantageous situation against Volibear.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that K'Sante has abundant crowd control (CC) against Volibear, particularly excelling in one-on-one situations. Volibear's main skills have short range and limited means of approach, making it easier for K'Sante to utilize his CC to control Volibear's attacks. Additionally, K'Sante's damage significantly increases in all-out situations, allowing him to gain the upper hand in trades with Volibear.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to first bait Volibear's Q and conserve W without using E. By avoiding Volibear's E, you create opportunities to counterattack in short trades. Also, be careful not to trigger Volibear's W healing consecutively, and engage in short trades while positioned behind minions for an advantage. After Volibear uses E, another opportunity to trade arises, so be sure not to miss that timing. Furthermore, if Volibear has certain items, he can become powerful in one-on-one situations, so consider applying pressure in team fights as well.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail becomes stronger as she levels up, and especially after level 6, her range increases, allowing her to attack from a distance. While Volibear is strong in early skirmishes, Kail is very weak at the start, but by using her R at level 6, she can create an invulnerable state and avoid Volibear's attacks. Additionally, Kail can use skills with slow effects to maintain distance from Volibear, reducing the risk of being approached.\n\nTo take advantage, first, avoid unnecessary trades in the early game and prioritize CS under the tower. Keep poking from a distance with Q and save W for escaping. Once you reach level 6, check Volibear's R and Flash, and actively poke. In the mid to late game, farm in the side lanes while aiming for Nashor or Riftmaker, and save R to counter Volibear's charges and CC, as it is important to deal continuous damage from range in team fights.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jax is an AA (auto-attack) reliant champion and is strong against short-range fighters like Volibear. Volibear's main skills are short-range, and his means of closing the gap are limited, making him susceptible to Jax's attacks. Additionally, Jax can negate Volibear's CC (crowd control) skills with his E, allowing him to gain the upper hand in trades.\n\nTo take advantage, start with a Doran's Shield to reduce damage from Volibear's passive. Engage in short trades while Volibear is using his E, and close the gap with Q to deal damage. Be cautious if marked by Volibear's W, but you can use E to negate his attack and counterattack. Also, considering Volibear's R for tower diving, avoid playing under the tower or attack after forcing him to use his skills to create a favorable situation. Staying near minions is also important to avoid losing experience and continue farming.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce excels at poking from a distance, particularly using his Q (Shock Blast) to deal damage to Volibear while controlling the lane. Volibear is strong in close combat, but he is very weak against harassment from Jayce's attack range and is likely to be whittled down before he can get close. Additionally, Jayce can use his E (Hammer) to restrict Volibear's movement, preventing him from closing the gap.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, you should hit Volibear with your Q through minions to chip away at his health and gain lane control. When Volibear approaches, it's important to use your E to counterattack while maintaining distance. After level 6, Volibear's ultimate becomes powerful, so it's necessary to keep your distance, secure vision, and be wary of bushes. Furthermore, after Jayce has his items, he can utilize burst damage to aim for a kill before Volibear can get close.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi has high base stats and healing capabilities against Volibear, and her attacks utilizing tentacles are particularly powerful. Volibear's main skills have a short range, and by landing Illaoi's E skill in close combat, she can counterattack effectively. Additionally, Illaoi can play aggressively even under the tower, allowing her to trade favorably by using her E to retaliate when Volibear attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is crucial to avoid Volibear's AOE attacks in the early game. Farming near your tower and allowing Volibear to push the wave can negate his attacks. After level 6, using E and R to counter Volibear while maintaining distance is key. Avoid close combat and time your E skill when Volibear approaches to gain the upper hand.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of item build, it is important to first purchase \"Black Cleaver\" and prioritize defensive items. This allows you to deal sustained damage to Volibear while increasing your durability. By placing tentacles near the tower and managing the wave, you can create a favorable situation against Volibear.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire can avoid Volibear's charge ability (Q) by using W (Pool), allowing him to gain an edge in short trades. Additionally, Bloodmire's Q provides sustain, making him good at maintaining lane and allowing him to heal while taking damage from Volibear. Furthermore, after level 6, he can counter Volibear with his R, enabling him to deal sustained damage in longer fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first safely farm until level 6, prioritizing healing while taking CS with Q. Avoid overusing E for wave pushing and save W to dodge Volibear's Q. After level 6, use R to look for opportunities to engage, attacking after Volibear uses his W to create a chance for a turnaround. Also, manage minions carefully to avoid fighting in positions where Volibear's Flash Q can easily hit. In team fights, use R from the backline and engage in prolonged battles to maintain an advantage over Volibear.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot has powerful skills in the early laning phase and can easily initiate favorable trades against Volibear. By using Urgot's E, he can prevent Volibear from approaching and poke with his Q. Additionally, Urgot has range, allowing him to deal damage while avoiding Volibear's short-range attacks. Furthermore, Urgot's passive enables him to deal sustained damage while avoiding Volibear's stun, making it easier to maintain an advantage in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo take advantage, it's important to start with E and stay in the wave. When Volibear approaches, auto-attack to trigger the passive early and aim to hit level 2 first. When Volibear pushes the wave, remain patient and farm with Q and auto-attacks. Also, keeping Flash ready for Volibear's R and utilizing Ghost makes it easier to escape. After level 9, if you have Titanic and Cleaver, you can pressure Volibear. Choosing Doran's Shield and Second Wind can reduce damage from Volibear's passive and create a more favorable situation.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora is extremely powerful in one-on-one duels, especially as she can counter Volibear's main skills. By using Fiora's W (Riposte), she can negate Volibear's CC skills and retaliate. Additionally, Fiora's passive provides extra damage and healing, which is very effective in whittling down Volibear's durability. Furthermore, Fiora can deal percentage damage to Volibear, allowing her to maintain an advantage even against tanky Volibear.\n\nTo take advantage, during the early laning phase (levels 1-5), focus on parrying Volibear's Q and E with W after he uses them, and retaliate. By positioning minions between you and Volibear, you can avoid unnecessary trades while aiming for vitals to deal damage. After level 6, be cautious of Volibear's R, and look for opportunities to engage after being hit by CC with W. Fiora's R allows her to escape or chase, so it's important to be flexible based on the situation.\n\nIn terms of item selection, early on, choose items like Doran's Blade and healing items, focusing on lifesteal and armor penetration against Volibear to fight more favorably. In team fights, aim for side splits, and when facing Volibear one-on-one, be mindful of the W duel to fight effectively.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus is favored.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus becomes extremely powerful in the late game, as his Q scales infinitely with stacks. In the early game, Volibear is strong, but Nasus can endure the early phase and safely farm minions with his Q to grow. Additionally, Nasus's W slow effect reduces Volibear's attack speed, giving him an advantage in trades.\n\nTo gain an advantage, it is important to avoid risky trades in the early game and ensure that you secure minions with your Q. You should create distance when Volibear uses his W or E, focusing on sustaining through the damage. Once you reach level 6, be cautious of Volibear's ultimate while aiming to contribute in team fights. Furthermore, you can stack your Q in the side lane, take down towers, and then teleport to join your teammates, thereby contributing to the entire team.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven possesses high mobility and burst damage in a short time, giving her several advantages against Volibear. First, Riven can quickly chip away at Volibear's durability by executing combos using her skills. Additionally, Riven can use her E (Blink) to avoid Volibear's stun, making it easier to negate his crowd control. Furthermore, Riven can push the lane quickly, applying pressure on her opponent while managing the minions.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Riven should use Q (Slice) and AA (Auto Attack) to engage in short trades and chip away at Volibear's HP. When Volibear approaches, she can use E to dodge the stun and look for a chance to counterattack. Upon reaching level 6, she should aim to deal significant damage with a full combo to potentially burst down Volibear. Additionally, managing the wave and using minions to isolate Volibear is crucial for creating a more favorable situation. Always be aware of jungle vision and look for opportunities to roam when Volibear is isolated.",
      "オーン": "Ornn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Ornn's durability increases as he levels up, and his strength in team fights becomes prominent. Ornn's skills have crowd control (CC), and particularly his R ability's knock-up is very effective for engaging in team fights. Additionally, Ornn can purchase items without recalling, making him good at lane maintenance, and he has high HP regeneration. In contrast, while Volibear is strong in early skirmishes, his main skills have short range, making him weak against team fights and ranged opponents.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Ornn to not push the wave in lane and manage minions while avoiding Volibear's skills. Specifically, using E to aim for a knock-up utilizing terrain and forcing Volibear to use his Flash or E is effective. After level 6, it is advisable to save R to negate Volibear's charge and look for a chance to counterattack. Ornn can aim for a prolonged fight, leveraging his healing and durability difference to secure victory. When Volibear initiates an attack, responding calmly and exploiting openings to counterattack is key.",
      "シェン": "Shen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Shen has high 1v1 performance against Volibear and possesses skills that negate auto-attacks, allowing him to effectively block Volibear's attacks. Additionally, by using Shen's E (Taunt), he can limit Volibear's attacks and gain an advantage in short trades. Furthermore, Shen's R (Ultimate) provides an infinite range shield, which allows him to support allies while deflecting Volibear's attacks, making it easier to establish lane dominance.\n\nTo take advantage, start by prioritizing farming from a distance at the beginning of the laning phase, using Q to poke at minions while trading little by little with auto-attacks. After Volibear uses his skills, dash in with E and perform a short trade with Q→W to deal damage without taking hits from Volibear. It's also important to be mindful of the positioning of the Taunt; by using W to immobilize before taking damage, you can disrupt Volibear's skills and buy time for your allies to react. Additionally, between 7 to 11 minutes, after pushing the top lane, prioritize roaming and use R to safely assist allies, which can help steer the overall flow of the game in your favor.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at harassing from a distance, and his E (Barrel) is particularly effective for zoning. Volibear is a melee champion and cannot deal damage without getting close, so by using barrels to maintain distance, Gangplank can avoid Volibear's attacks. Additionally, Gangplank's Q (Cannon) has a long range, allowing him to safely deal damage to Volibear.\n\nTo take advantage, at the beginning, place barrels in the backline while avoiding Volibear's AA (auto attacks) to harass. Between levels 2 and 3, use E (Barrel) to deter Volibear's engage and deal damage with the barrel explosion. When Volibear approaches, use barrels to slow him down and prepare to escape with Flash. After level 6, it is important to use R (Cannon Barrage) to assist other lanes while safely scaling.\n\nIn this way, Gangplank can establish an advantage in the lane against Volibear."

      "チョ＝ガス": "Cho'Gath is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the high mobility and damage output that Kayn possesses after transforming. In particular, Red Kayn has powerful percentage damage against tanks, which threatens Cho'Gath's durability. Additionally, Kayn has the ability to go over walls, making it easier for him to target Cho'Gath when he is isolated, putting him at a disadvantage in 1v1 situations. Furthermore, Cho'Gath's skills have a slow activation time, making it difficult to respond to Kayn's rapid attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Prioritize Warding**: It is important to secure vision and track Kayn's movements to prevent ganks from the jungle.\n2. **Item Selection**: Purchasing items like Bramble Vest or tough gear early can help suppress Kayn's healing, maintaining an advantage in prolonged fights.\n3. **Positioning in Team Fights**: It is crucial to avoid isolation and coordinate with allies to prevent Kayn's engagement, increasing opportunities to utilize Cho'Gath's crowd control.",
      "トリンダメア": "Tremendous is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has the ability to transform into either an assassin or a fighter, and particularly when he transforms into an assassin (Blue Kayn), his burst damage in a short time becomes extremely high. Tryndamere is weak against crowd control and has difficulty dealing with Kayn's wall-jumping and ambushes, making his positioning especially challenging in the early game and during team fights. Additionally, Kayn has high mobility, which means he can take the initiative before Tryndamere can build up Fury to attack.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to secure vision and always keep track of Kayn's movements. Specifically, when Kayn uses his E to jump over walls, Tryndamere should conserve his Fury and be prepared to either escape using his E or chase. Prioritizing lifesteal as an item and taking early measures against defense and healing penetration can also allow for a prolonged battle. After level 6, utilizing R to withstand Kayn's attacks while looking for counterattack opportunities can be effective as well.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has high mobility and burst damage, making him particularly strong against Sion in the early game. While Sion has more durability against Kayn before his transformation, he can be quickly whittled down if Kayn gets behind him with his E. Additionally, Kayn can use his shadow to close the gap and deal damage instantly, which makes Sion's slow skill activation a disadvantage. Furthermore, while being cautious of Sion's R, Kayn will aggressively engage if he is confident of a kill, forcing Sion to constantly manage his health.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid unnecessary fights in the early game and prioritize farming CS. Actively using wards to secure vision and track Kayn's movements is also crucial. In team fights, Sion should utilize his R to coordinate with allies and ensure that Kayn does not become isolated. Additionally, by using Sion's W for shielding and increasing durability, he can better withstand Kayn's burst damage.",
      "クレッド": "Kled is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn possesses the traits of an assassin or fighter after transforming, and particularly in his assassin form, he has strong short-term burst damage. While Kled is strong in short engagements, he is vulnerable to Kayn's mobility and ambush capabilities. Additionally, Kayn has low combat ability before transforming, but after transforming, he is also strong in prolonged fights, meaning that even if Kled initiates an attack, Kayn may be able to withstand it. Furthermore, if Kayn's CC skills restrict Kled's movement, Kled's strength in sticking to opponents will be diminished.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to secure vision early on to avoid Kayn's ambushes and not to force trades unnecessarily. Additionally, one should be aware of Kayn's transformation before reaching level 6 and adjust positioning to avoid attacks after he transforms. Kled can conserve his W and use it at the right moment to avoid going down. In team fights, it is crucial for Kled to take the initiative to prevent attacks from Kayn from behind and to clarify his role.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that when Kayn transforms into Rhaast (red Kayn), he can deal powerful percentage damage to Dr. Mundo. Rhaast has high healing capabilities in prolonged fights and can suppress Dr. Mundo's self-healing. Additionally, Kayn has high mobility and can effectively harass while avoiding Dr. Mundo's attacks using his W and E abilities. Furthermore, if Kayn's CC skills restrict Dr. Mundo's actions, his durability can significantly decrease.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be noted. First, it is important to farm safely in the early game and use Q for minion clearing and health recovery. Next, avoiding short engagements with Kayn after he transforms into Rhaast and opting for side pushes can be an effective strategy to avoid team fights. Additionally, selecting counter items like Spirit Visage and health items to enhance healing is crucial. Furthermore, purchasing Bramble Vest or Thornmail can help suppress Kayn's healing. Finally, utilizing teleport to prioritize side lanes and maintain an advantageous lane situation is important.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has the ability to disrupt Yorick's split push through jungle intervention. In particular, after transforming, Kayn can deal burst damage with his blue (Shadow) form and has sustain with his red (Rascal) form, which means that even if Yorick tries to engage in a 1v1 after level 6 using his R, he could end up in a disadvantageous situation depending on Kayn's form. Additionally, Kayn has high mobility and the ability to traverse walls, making it easier to counter Yorick's wall-based tactics. Furthermore, since Kayn has crowd control (CC), there is a risk that Yorick's combat effectiveness will decrease if he summons his pets and gets hit by CC.\n\nTo mitigate the disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. **Wave Management**: It is important for Yorick to manage the minion wave properly and avoid over-pushing to make it harder for Kayn to gank.\n2. **Vision Control**: Securing vision on the sides and keeping track of Kayn's movements can help prevent ambushes. In particular, using wards to gain information about the jungle is crucial.\n3. **Item Selection**: Purchasing armor items early to counter Kayn's attacks and increase durability is effective.\n4. **Team Coordination**: Yorick can coordinate with his jungler to apply pressure before Kayn arrives for a gank, allowing him to create a more favorable 1v1 situation.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has powerful damage after transforming, and especially Red Kayn (Rhaast) has high healing capabilities in prolonged fights, allowing him to surpass Shen's durability. Additionally, Shen lacks AoE damage and tends to rely on his allies for damage output in team fights, while Kayn excels at dealing burst and sustained damage, making it difficult for Shen to gain an advantage. Furthermore, Kayn is skilled at ambushing using his mobility skills and wall-jumping abilities, and when Shen is hindered by his W or taunt, he can easily become vulnerable.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play cautiously until level 3 and avoid Kayn's engage. Save your W, and when Kayn initiates, use W to block auto-attacks and aim for a taunt with E to create a chance for counterattack. Additionally, it is effective to avoid prolonged fights with Red Kayn and focus on short skirmishes. Moreover, securing vision and preparing for Kayn's E or ambushes from bushes can help reduce risks. In terms of items, choosing sturdy gear (armor + HP) can enhance durability and reduce Kayn's damage.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has high mobility, and especially in his Red form, he can deal significant burst damage before Warwick can close the gap. Additionally, Kayn can use his Shadow Step to escape, making it easier for him to avoid Warwick's attacks. Furthermore, Warwick lacks AoE damage skills, making it difficult for him to deal damage in team fights, particularly against high-mobility assassins like Kayn. Even if Warwick tries to catch Kayn with his ultimate, Kayn can often effectively evade it by maintaining distance.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to secure vision in the early game and avoid Kayn's ganks. Additionally, by utilizing Blood Hunt to ambush an isolated Kayn, Warwick can create opportunities to gain an advantage. In team fights, it is crucial to maintain distance to avoid Kayn's ultimate while using allies' crowd control to ensure his elimination. Moreover, split-pushing to divide Kayn can also be an effective strategy to prevent him from leveraging his strengths.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has high mobility and can easily avoid Ornn's skills by utilizing his ability to go over walls. Especially in the case of Blue Kayn, he can quickly dash through Ornn's skills to attack, dealing damage while avoiding Ornn's E and R. Additionally, after transforming, Kayn possesses assassin traits, making it easier for him to carry in team fights and deal damage that ignores Ornn's durability.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Ornn to manage minions thoroughly in lane and position himself to avoid Kayn's attacks. Specifically, he needs to understand Kayn's skill cooldowns and time his counterattacks when Kayn initiates. Furthermore, Ornn should prioritize building tank items early to increase his durability, which can help reduce Kayn's damage and lead to a war of attrition. Additionally, coordinating with the ally jungler to set up ganks can effectively apply pressure on Kayn.",
      "アンベッサ": "Anbessa is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn becomes significantly powerful after reaching level 6, especially when he transforms into Rhaast, as he gains sustained damage and healing capabilities, making him very strong in team fights and one-on-one situations. Anbessa can gain an advantage in the early game with short-range dashes and sustained damage, but once Kayn reaches level 6, his ultimate can drastically change the tide of battle. Additionally, Kayn has the ability to traverse walls, making it easier for him to avoid Anbessa's attacks and complicating positioning.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to play cautiously in the early game and trade while being wary of Kayn's E. Creating as favorable a situation as possible before reaching level 6 and maneuvering to avoid jungle interference is essential. In terms of item selection, prioritizing items like Black Cleaver and combining them with durability items (such as Sterak's Gage or Death's Dance) can effectively reduce Kayn's damage and enhance sustained combat ability. In team fights, it is crucial to use your ultimate to shut down Kayn's carry and coordinate with your allies' crowd control.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has an early jungle-oriented playstyle, making it easier for him to gank while Gwen safely farms CS behind minions. Additionally, after transforming, Kayn can choose the shadow form, which gives him high burst damage, potentially catching Gwen off guard before she reaches level 6. Furthermore, Gwen has a short range, making it difficult to avoid Kayn's mobility-based attacks, and since her crowd control is only a slow, she is vulnerable to Kayn's knock-up.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to safely farm CS behind minions in the early game while using wards to keep track of Kayn's movements. Also, when reaching level 6, using her ultimate to look for counterattack opportunities and initiating short trades can be effective. Moreover, if Kayn has chosen the shadow form, it is necessary to actively create distance and focus on positioning in team fights to enhance survivability in the fog of war.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn can utilize his mobility to evade and invade against Braum, who has low early-game combat ability. Kayn can use his E to dodge Braum's attacks, and after transforming, he can leverage his assassin traits to target Braum. Furthermore, Kayn has the ability to go over walls, making it difficult for Braum to approach, especially in team fights where Kayn's assassin form can easily target Braum's backline.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Braum to actively gank from the early game to delay Kayn's form progression. Additionally, securing vision and tracking Kayn's movements can prevent him from using his E to evade. Moreover, Braum excels at tower diving, so applying pressure early before Kayn can farm in lane can help suppress Kayn's growth. In team fights, using Braum's R to take the initiative can neutralize Kayn's assassin form.",
      "ジャックス": "Jax is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn has high ambush potential in the early game, especially utilizing his mobility to catch Jax off guard. Jax needs to prioritize farming in the early game and must adopt a strategy of mitigating damage with his E while conserving his stun, but it is difficult to deal with Kayn's burst damage (in Shadow Form). Additionally, if Kayn transforms into Rhaast, Jax will be at a disadvantage in prolonged fights due to his inferior sustain.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming in the early game while conserving E for Kayn's ambushes. After level 6, it is necessary to adjust your actions based on Kayn's form. In Shadow Form, it is effective to avoid isolation, while in Rhaast form, aiming for prolonged fights is beneficial. Furthermore, in terms of itemization, it is recommended to build durability items early and to acquire Trinity Force quickly to leverage Jax's attack speed buff. It is also crucial to prioritize vision and be wary of Kayn's ambushes.",
      "パンテオン": "Pantheon is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayn prioritizes farming in the early game, and while waiting for his transformation, Pantheon can apply strong pressure between levels 1 and 5. Pantheon can easily deal damage with short combos using W→Q or E, making him favorable in early trades, but Kayn has low combat ability before his transformation and needs to avoid risky trades. However, after Kayn transforms into Shadow Assassin or Rhaast, he can exert pressure on Pantheon with burst damage and sustain, making it difficult for Pantheon to deal with Kayn post-transformation.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid risky trades in the early game and prioritize farming minions. Additionally, utilizing R at level 6 for roaming can help apply pressure in other lanes, delaying Kayn's transformation. Furthermore, if Kayn goes missing, using wards to secure vision and managing side lanes can help avoid prolonged fights. In team fights, it is effective for Pantheon to take the initiative and disrupt Kayn's target selection.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that while Kayn has low combat ability before transforming, after transformation he possesses the traits of a powerful assassin or fighter, and especially when he transforms into Shadow Kayn, he can deal high damage instantly. Yone has strong pushing power in the early lane, but he is vulnerable to Kayn's post-transformation attack power and mobility, particularly taking significant damage from Kayn's E and R abilities. Additionally, Kayn has the ability to traverse walls, which can put Yone in a disadvantageous situation when trying to escape.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to apply pressure on Kayn from the early game and exploit his weaknesses before he transforms. Using wards to secure vision and track Kayn's movements can help avoid ganks. Furthermore, after level 6, it is necessary to adjust your playstyle according to Kayn's form, especially maintaining distance when facing Shadow Kayn. In team fights, using Yone's R to disrupt from the side and divert Kayn's attacks can also be effective."

      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot excels in prolonged fights at close to mid-range, especially exploiting Kayn's vulnerability before his transformation. Urgot can harass with his Q and control the opponent's movements with his E while dealing damage, preventing Kayn from finding opportunities to engage. Additionally, Urgot can deal significant damage when he brings the opponent into kill range with his R, making him particularly advantageous after level 6. Even when Kayn transforms into Rhaast, Urgot's high durability and crowd control allow him to maintain an advantage in extended fights.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, keep the lane positioned towards the center or slightly in your favor while harassing Kayn and zoning him from using his E. Specifically, use the Q→E combo to safely chip away at his health, and use W to absorb counterattacks while managing the lane without pushing too hard. After level 6, once you can bring Kayn into kill range with your R, you can immediately engage to establish dominance over him. Additionally, in terms of item selection, choosing items like Black Cleaver and boots, and building magic resistance as needed, is crucial to enhance your durability against Kayn's attacks.",
      "グラガス": "Gragas has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gragas can poke from a distance with his Q, exploiting Kayn's early-game weakness. Additionally, Gragas's W provides healing and durability, making it easier to withstand Kayn's attacks. Furthermore, Gragas's R is very effective at disrupting enemy formations and interrupting Kayn's engage. Before Kayn transforms, his combat ability is low, allowing Gragas to take advantage of that window.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game (1-6), it's important to chip away at Kayn with Q while sustaining with W and avoiding Kayn's E engage. After level 3, Gragas can take favorable short trades, and it's essential to use plenty of wards against Kayn's ambushes and coordinate with teammates. After level 6, it's crucial to save R for Kayn's engage, be wary of blue Kayn's burst potential, and play patiently against red Kayn. In team fights, using R with the intention of targeting Kayn and positioning to protect allies will be advantageous. In terms of build, stacking armor and health against red Kayn and building tabi and health against blue Kayn will effectively increase durability.",
      "ヤスオ": "Yasuo has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yasuo has high burst damage and can leverage his mobility from E to play favorably against Kayn. Additionally, by using W, he can block Kayn's ranged attacks, allowing him to effectively mitigate Kayn's damage while harassing, especially in the early game. Furthermore, after level 6, Yasuo can execute instant kill combos with his R, putting strong pressure on Kayn.\n\nTo gain the advantage, prioritize CS in the early game and stack Q while harassing. It's important to use E to safely approach through minions and avoid Kayn's attacks. Particularly when Kayn is in shadow form, short skirmishes are advantageous, so be aggressive in attacking. After level 6, be cautious of Kayn's R while looking for opportunities to engage with your team's CC. In team fights, use R in sync with your allies to isolate Kayn.",
      "ジェイス": "Jayce has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Jayce excels at long-range attacks and short-term burst damage, making it easier to prevent Kayn from closing the distance. In particular, by using Jayce's E (Acceleration Gate), he can increase his movement speed and deal high damage with his Q (Shock Blast), allowing him to harass Kayn significantly before he can get close. Additionally, Kayn has low combat ability before transforming and is vulnerable to Jayce's early burst.\n\nTo maintain the advantage, it is important to first use wards to check the enemy jungle entry points and keep track of Kayn's movements. If Kayn is not visible, avoid engaging and prioritize harassing by using E→Q to deal damage while keeping your distance. When Kayn approaches, utilize bushes to gain vision, switch forms with R (Transformation), and safely disengage with the gate. It is also crucial to cooperate with teammates to secure vision and prevent Kayn's ambushes. This way, Jayce can maintain a favorable situation against Kayn.",
      "ガレン": "Garen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Garen has high durability and healing abilities, allowing him to gain an edge over Kayn, especially in short trades during the early game. By silencing Kayn with Garen's Q, he can disable Kayn's skills and quickly deal damage with his E. Additionally, Kayn has low combat ability before transforming and is particularly vulnerable in the early game, so Garen can take advantage by being aggressive.\n\nTo gain the advantage, in the early game (levels 1-5), use short combos (Q→E→AA) to chip away at Kayn's health while using W to mitigate damage and restrict the opponent's movements. Before reaching level 6, it is important not to chase too aggressively and to consider Kayn's escape potential, maintaining distance. After level 6, if Kayn transforms into Rhaast (red), Garen can avoid prolonged fights by purchasing armor early and increasing his durability to fight effectively. In team fights, he can contribute to the team by taking down targets at the front line while being cautious of Kayn's flanking and disrupting him with silence or Flash.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo has the advantage.\n\nTeemo has ranged attacks and can disrupt Kayn's reliance on auto-attacks. In particular, Teemo's Q (Blind) can nullify Kayn's normal attacks, allowing him to maintain an advantage in close combat. Additionally, Teemo can use mushrooms (R) to control vision and limit enemy movement, making it difficult for Kayn to approach. Furthermore, by focusing on poking from the early game, Teemo can create a health advantage over Kayn, allowing him to engage in fights more favorably.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first focus on poking in the early lane phase, charging Q to gain an edge in auto-attack trades. Next, place wards and mushrooms in bushes, the river, and at the enemy jungle exit to prevent Kayn's entry. When Kayn approaches with E or W, use Q to blind him, then back off to maximize the blind duration. Once a health advantage is established, increase pressure and place mushrooms on the side to restrict Kayn's movement. This way, Teemo can maintain a favorable situation against Kayn.",
      "カミール": "Camille has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Camille can strongly pressure Kayn when he is not yet evolved in the early game. Before his transformation, Kayn has low combat ability and is particularly vulnerable in the early stages. Camille can easily create a health difference against Kayn by utilizing short trades with Q→AA→W. Additionally, Camille's passive shield and high burst damage can surpass Kayn's healing capabilities.\n\nTo take advantage, first, actively trade while Kayn is not evolved in the early game, repeatedly using Q→AA→W for short trades to chip away at his health. If Kayn is in Shadow form, it's important to create distance with E, and if he is in Rhaast form, be cautious of prolonged fights while choosing items that won't lead to sustain loss. Upon reaching level 6, it is effective to be aware of Kayn's ultimate, conserve your R for crowd control, and prioritize ganks while coordinating with allies to secure kills.",
      "ブラッドミア": "Bloodmire has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Bloodmire has very strong sustain and is particularly resistant to Kayn's short-term burst. When Kayn is in his Shadow form, he aims for damage in a short time, so Bloodmire can utilize the invulnerability effect of his W to counterattack. Additionally, Bloodmire excels at trading after charging his E, and he can fight while recovering health with his Q, allowing him to maintain an advantage in prolonged combat.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game, maintain distance while charging E, hitting minions and recovering health with Q. When Kayn attacks, use W to avoid the burst and look for a chance to counterattack. In the mid-game and beyond, leverage sustain to participate in team fights, using R to charge in while attacking. Also, building magic resistance is important as it allows you to stand strong against Rhaast form Kayn, making equipment choices crucial.",
      "イレリア": "Irelia has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Irelia excels at short bursts and is strong in brief skirmishes due to her Q resets. Additionally, she has guaranteed crowd control with her E, which can restrict Kayn's movements. Before transforming, Kayn has low combat ability and is particularly vulnerable in the early game, allowing Irelia to take advantage by being aggressive.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it's important to first use minions to reset Q and engage in small trades. The goal is to use E to limit Kayn's movements and create a favorable situation before level 6. After level 6, if Kayn is in his Rhaast form, it's effective to avoid prolonged fights, while if he is in his Shadow form, taking the initiative in short burst trades is beneficial. Additionally, choosing items like \"Death's Dance\" or \"Black Cleaver\" for healing countermeasures can ensure toughness against Kayn. Constantly check Kayn's form and positioning, and utilizing E as a decisive blow will be key to victory.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton is strong in early short trades and can deal high burst damage by managing his Fury. In particular, by using his E to engage and aiming for a stun with his W, he can disrupt Kayn's sustain and avoid prolonging the fight. Additionally, Renekton has short cooldowns on his skills, allowing him to trade favorably in lane and gain an advantage before Kayn transforms.\n\nTo take advantage, you should conserve your Q between levels 1 and 3, engage briefly with E, and aim for a burst with W. By managing Fury and focusing on stuns, you can hinder Kayn's healing. After level 6, use your R to increase your durability, negate follow-ups or disengages, and control vision to block Kayn's E path, securing further advantages.",
      "クイン": "Quinn has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Quinn possesses high mobility and burst damage, and she exhibits strong denial against Kayn, who has low approachability. By utilizing Quinn's passive in combos, she can exploit Kayn's vulnerable state before he transforms, allowing her to deal damage early on. Additionally, Quinn can attack from a distance, making it easier to inflict damage before Kayn can get close.\n\nTo maintain the advantage, Quinn should actively harass from the early game, ensuring that Kayn has no opportunity to stack his orb. It's important to harass with Q and attack while maintaining distance with W, and when Kayn approaches, she can either escape with E or retaliate. Furthermore, when Kayn attempts to gank, securing vision and using her ultimate to roam quickly can help Quinn gain advantages in other lanes as well.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is very strong in one-on-one combat from early to mid-game. By utilizing his passive for sustained damage and the bleeding effect from his E, he can gain an upper hand against Kayn. Additionally, Darius excels in close-range brawls, and before Kayn transforms, his combat ability is low, allowing Darius to fight advantageously.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane, use Q to harass and stack bleeding damage with E. When Darius reaches level 6, it becomes important to use Flash or E to catch Kayn, as he becomes easier to escape, and aim for a kill with R. Furthermore, if Kayn has transformed into Rhaast, building Bramble Vest or early armor items can help suppress his healing while allowing Darius to maintain an advantage in prolonged fights. It is crucial to use Teleport and roam carefully, assessing the opponent's movements while maneuvering.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble has high early-game damage and strong traits for short trades. In particular, he can continuously deal damage using his Q, making it easy to exploit Kayn's vulnerable state before his transformation. Additionally, Rumble's R deals persistent damage and slows enemies within its range, allowing him to apply significant pressure when Kayn approaches. Furthermore, Rumble can easily secure vision and has the ability to control lanes, making it easier to be wary of Kayn's ganks and side lane invasions.\n\nTo take advantage, first, for the first five minutes, actively push with Rumble's Q to apply pressure on Kayn. It's important to place wards to monitor the river and side paths, keeping track of Kayn's movements. Before level 6, avoid risky isolated actions and coordinate with teammates to prevent Kayn's counter-invasions. After level 6, if Kayn is in blue form, he may be able to be taken down quickly, so securing vision and calling for teammates is crucial. In red form, he becomes disadvantaged in extended fights, so use R to create distance while continuing to set up team fights with R, prioritizing wards and controlling the sides to prevent Kayn from flanking.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gangplank excels at harassing from a distance, and zoning with barrels using his Q is particularly effective. Before transforming, Kayn has low combat ability and is especially vulnerable in the early game, allowing Gangplank to safely secure CS with his long-range skills while applying pressure on Kayn. Additionally, Gangplank's W can remove crowd control, enhancing his survivability when attacked by Kayn.\n\nTo take advantage, first, safely secure CS using Q in the early game and set up barrels to limit Kayn's movements. When Kayn approaches, it is important to use W to remove slows while increasing attack speed to counterattack. Also, since Kayn may try to cross walls with Flash or E, securing bushes and vision, and using R to assist other lanes in time with roams can be effective. Furthermore, balancing durability and burst damage with items allows for an advantageous position even in prolonged fights.",
      "ケイル": "Kayn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kayle becomes stronger as she levels up, and especially after level 6, she gains the ability to attack from a distance, dealing powerful DPS. Kayn is strong in the early game, but his combat ability is low before transforming, making it difficult for him to approach a ranged carry like Kayle. Additionally, Kayle can create an invulnerable state with her R, making it easier to avoid Kayn's attacks.\n\nTo gain an advantage, in the early game (0-5 minutes), it's important for Kayle to prioritize minions and focus on CS while maintaining distance. When Kayn approaches, she should use her Q to create space and be ready to escape with her E. In the mid-game (6-11 minutes), it's wise to gauge when Kayn is trying to engage and retreat if he doesn't have his ultimate. After level 16, Kayle's strength increases, allowing her to deal damage in team fights alongside her allies and overwhelm Kayn.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven has the advantage.\n\nRiven has powerful short-term trading capabilities from the early game, especially between levels 1 and 3, where she can apply pressure on Kayn using a combo of Q and auto-attacks. Before transforming, Kayn has low combat ability and is particularly vulnerable in the early game, making him susceptible to Riven's attacks. Additionally, Riven can use skills that provide crowd control to limit Kayn's actions, allowing her to fight at an advantage.\n\nTo take advantage, first select Flash and TP or Ignite in the pre-game, and actively engage in short-term trades from the early game. Between levels 1 and 3, use the Q+AA combo to deny Kayn's CS while using E to avoid damage and maximize Riven's damage output. After level 6, use R to expand kill range, being cautious of Shadow Kayn to avoid overcommitting, while aiming for short skirmishes against Red Kayn to maintain an advantage. It is also important to place wards to prepare for jungle ganks and secure vision.",
      "シンジド": "Singed has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Singed excels at dealing sustained damage, especially against the vulnerable state of Kayn before his transformation. Singed's poison-spreading skills can deal continuous damage as Kayn approaches, allowing him to accumulate damage before Kayn can engage. Additionally, Singed has high movement speed, making it easier to avoid Kayn's attacks and, conversely, to corner Kayn.\n\nTo take advantage of this, first, use wards to keep an eye on the surroundings in the early game, preventing Kayn's ganks while farming with poison. When Kayn approaches, create distance with Q while spreading poison and prepare to escape with W. After level 6, use E to limit Kayn's movements, and in team fights, spreading poison can create chaos, making it easier for allies to deal damage. Furthermore, in terms of items, prioritize armor while choosing items like Abyssal or Warmog's to enhance durability while maintaining sustained damage.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Fiora has powerful percentage damage against tank champions, allowing her to gain an edge, especially in one-on-one combat. Additionally, Fiora's W (Riposte) can negate Kayn's skills and apply a stun, effectively blocking his attacks. Furthermore, after level 6, Fiora can use her R (Grand Duelist) to apply kill pressure and create favorable situations against Kayn.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, carefully engage in short trades while aiming for the passive Vital to deal damage. Assess Kayn's skills and use W (Riposte) to block his attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack. After level 6, actively seek kills using R (Grand Duelist) while paying attention to side lanes and roaming, maintaining an advantageous position against Kayn. Additionally, if Kayn is in a healing build, it is important to prepare Bramble or sustain countermeasures early on.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite can manage distance with his Q and weaken Kayn's attacks. Additionally, by using his E, he can counter Kayn, who relies on auto-attacks, and especially when Kayn engages, he can use his R to turn team fights in his favor. Furthermore, Malphite has high physical defense, making him very strong against AD champions, which allows him to withstand Kayn's attacks more easily.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to use Q to maintain distance in the early lane phase and avoid prolonged fights. If Kayn shows signs of engaging, use E to limit his auto-attacks, and then follow up with R to disrupt Kayn's movements. Also, if Kayn is in the last form, building armor items early and using Bramble to hinder his healing can be effective. In the shadow form, using R in team fights and avoiding one-on-one encounters can help maintain the advantage.",
      "エイトロックス": "Aatrox has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Aatrox can deal powerful damage and crowd control to opponents with low instant mobility, making it relatively easy to handle Kayn's \"Shadow Assassin\" form before his transformation. Additionally, Aatrox's passive healing effect allows for sustained combat, making it easier to maintain durability while taking damage from Kayn's attacks. Furthermore, Aatrox's skills have area damage, making it easier to deal damage when Kayn approaches.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively engage before Kayn transforms into his \"Rascal\" form. Specifically, utilizing consecutive attacks with Q and aiming for knock-ups with W can restrict Kayn's movements. By using E to close the distance or escape, you can avoid Kayn's attacks while dealing damage. After the transformation, it is crucial to maneuver carefully, avoiding Kayn's attacks while looking for opportunities to counterattack."

  "トランドル": {
    "name": "トランドル",
    "beats": {
      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle has high durability and healing, making him particularly strong in prolonged fights. While Quinn excels in short trades, Trundle's R (Subjugate) can lower her stats, causing her to lose her advantage in one-on-one encounters. Additionally, if Trundle uses his E (Pillar) to block her approach, Quinn has limited means to avoid attacks, making it difficult for her to deal effective damage. Furthermore, Trundle can freeze minions to maintain pressure, making Quinn more susceptible to harassment in lane.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, the following points can be considered:\n1. After pushing the lane, actively roam to target kills in other lanes to increase overall impact.\n2. Pay attention to positioning to avoid Trundle's E (Pillar) and harass from as safe a distance as possible.\n3. Strengthen coordination with the jungle to set up ganks on Trundle, creating an advantageous situation early on.\n4. Manage wards effectively to keep track of Trundle's movements and avoid unnecessary engagements.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle's R absorbs Riven's armor and magic resist, reducing her durability in prolonged fights. Trundle has high healing potential with his Q and can disrupt Riven's engage with his E pillar, making it difficult for Riven to approach. Additionally, Riven has many mobility skills, and if she gets caught by Trundle's E, she may be unable to do anything. Furthermore, since Riven is an auto-attack-based champion, it becomes challenging to deal damage against Trundle's tankiness.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively seek short trades from the early game and avoid Trundle's Q. As for items, purchasing boots or Bramble Vest early can effectively reduce healing. Additionally, using Riven's combos to deal burst damage and aiming for a kill before Trundle uses his R can also be effective. By expecting jungle intervention and applying pressure on Trundle, Riven can create favorable situations.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle is strong in prolonged fights, and with his W's healing and Q's lifesteal, he can withstand Garen's burst damage in short engagements. Additionally, Trundle's R steals Garen's armor, reducing Garen's damage in one-on-one situations while simultaneously enhancing Trundle. Furthermore, if Trundle uses his E (Pillar) to block Garen's approach, it becomes difficult for Garen to initiate attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, Garen should engage in short trades from the early game, using minions to break line of sight while applying silence with his Q. Also, to counter Trundle's healing, Garen should prioritize purchasing Executioner or Bramble Vest early to avoid prolonged fights. Moreover, if Garen can secure a kill with his R before Trundle activates his R, it could turn the situation in Garen's favor.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Trundle's strong 1v1 capabilities and sustain. Trundle can steal Yorick's armor with his R, gaining an advantage in direct confrontations. Additionally, Trundle's E (Pillar) restricts movement, significantly impacting Yorick's combat style, especially when Yorick is using his pets; if they are separated, his combat effectiveness drops considerably. Furthermore, while Trundle relies on auto-attacks, making it difficult for him to deal with Yorick's wall and pets, Trundle's healing and durability pose a threat to Yorick.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is crucial to avoid unnecessary direct confrontations in the early game and prioritize collecting CS from minions. You can use E to poke Trundle and summon ghouls to create a slightly more favorable situation. It is also important to time your W to block Trundle's charges and Pillar while looking for an opportunity to combine it with Maiden. Additionally, purchasing Bramble Vest early can help suppress Trundle's healing, allowing you to gain an advantage in fights.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is largely due to Trundle's short-term duel potential and his ability to disrupt positioning with his E. Trundle excels at short trades with his Q and can attack while hindering Mundo's movement with his E. Additionally, Trundle's R can strip away Mundo's durability, making it difficult to engage in prolonged fights. Furthermore, Mundo lacks crowd control, and there is a risk that his healing will be hindered when taking damage from Trundle.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid forced engagements in the early game, utilizing Q for ranged pokes to secure minions while conserving health. Additionally, look for opportunities to counterattack after Trundle uses his E, and after level 6, aim to use R for healing to transition into a longer fight. Moreover, be cautious against opponents with healing reduction items and position yourself safely in the backline to engage in fights.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle has an R that absorbs Ornn's armor, which reduces Ornn's durability. Additionally, Trundle's Q healing effect and E (Pillar) restrict Ornn's movement, making it difficult for him to attack or escape. Ornn requires preparation to apply crowd control, and he often reacts slowly to Trundle's attacks, especially in short trades, putting him at a disadvantage. Furthermore, since Trundle relies on auto-attacks, he can easily deal damage while ignoring Ornn's W shield.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize defensive items early on. Choosing heavy armor or items with anti-heal effects can reduce Trundle's damage. After level 6, utilizing R to initiate crowd control and coordinating with allies to attack is effective. Being cautious of Trundle's E (Pillar) and positioning strategically can help create advantageous situations while being wary of ganks. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid long trades by leveraging the minion difference and preventing Trundle's healing.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle is an AA-dependent fighter and has strong abilities against tanks. When Trundle uses his R to steal Sion's defensive stats, Sion becomes disadvantaged in one-on-one situations. Additionally, Trundle's E knockback and slow hinder Sion's approach, making it difficult for Sion to land attacks. Furthermore, Trundle has high sustain and can recover HP by killing nearby enemy units, allowing him to perform well in prolonged fights.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Sion to poke Trundle early with Q and E while maintaining distance. Utilizing the passive of W to increase HP and enhance durability is also effective. In the mid-game, creating team fights with R and either escaping before Trundle activates his R or coordinating with allies to follow up can help suppress Trundle's strengths. Additionally, strengthening defense through item builds to withstand Trundle's attacks is crucial.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason for this is due to Trundle's powerful AA-dependent skill set and the knockback and slow CC effects from his E. Trundle can gain an advantage by absorbing his own AR/MR while taking Warwick's attacks. Additionally, Trundle's passive allows him to heal by killing nearby enemy units, making it easier to maintain lane and giving him an edge in sustained fights. Furthermore, Trundle can easily kite and peel against Warwick, who has limited mobility, making it difficult for Warwick to land his attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize farming in lane and to position yourself carefully to avoid Trundle's attacks. Also, avoid 1v1 encounters with Trundle before reaching level 6, and when looking for ganks, coordinate with your jungler for effective action. As for items, purchasing gear that increases HP or tank-oriented items that can reduce Trundle's damage early on will help improve your durability. Additionally, securing vision and keeping track of Trundle's movements is crucial to prevent him from capitalizing on his strengths.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Trundle has a strong matchup against Olaf. Trundle's Q skill can chip away at Olaf's health early on, making it difficult for him to farm in lane. Additionally, Trundle's passive allows him to heal by killing nearby enemy units, which makes him good at maintaining lane presence. Furthermore, Trundle's R skill absorbs Olaf's armor, putting Olaf in a disadvantageous position in one-on-one situations. Olaf lacks mobility, and if he gets kited by Trundle's slow effects, he will struggle to land his attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it's important to position yourself cleverly at level 1, forcing Trundle to use his first Q on last-hitting minions to gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, seeking help from the jungler to counter Trundle can be effective. It's crucial to farm safely under the tower and avoid dying. After level 6, it becomes difficult to counter Trundle's R skill, so the primary goal should be to survive and aim for victory in team fights or skirmishes.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage. The reason is that Trundle is strong in prolonged fights, especially because he can leverage his W's healing effect to gain an advantage in extended engagements. Additionally, if Trundle uses his E to position himself and his Pillar to block Fiora's Q escape, Fiora is likely to miss opportunities to attack. Furthermore, when Trundle absorbs Fiora's AR/MR with his R, her damage decreases, and she loses her advantage in one-on-one situations.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important for Fiora to closely observe Trundle's skills and use her W to parry his Q and R to prevent damage. Additionally, to avoid Trundle's Pillar, she can use her E to reposition and quickly attack the Vital for a short-term resolution. Moreover, by watching the jungle situation and looking for opportunities when Trundle is isolated, Fiora can capitalize on her strengths.",
      "ケイル": "Kail is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Kail is very weak in the early game, and especially until she reaches level 6, she often finds herself at a disadvantage against Trundle. Trundle has strong 1v1 performance from levels 1 to 5, able to steal AD with his Q and disrupt positioning with his E. Furthermore, Trundle's R increases his durability, making it easy for Kail to find herself in a disadvantageous situation in prolonged fights. Additionally, Kail lacks hard CC and is vulnerable to Trundle's E knockback and slow.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to prioritize CS without taking unnecessary risks in the early game and to avoid Trundle's attacks. Using Q to harass from a distance and escaping while healing with W is necessary. It is also crucial to secure vision to avoid ambushes from Trundle's E. Choosing defensive boots and using R to counter Trundle's full combo after reaching level 6 can help turn fights in Kail's favor.",
      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle relies on auto-attacks and has strong abilities, especially against tanks. By absorbing armor with Trundle's R, he can reduce K'Sante's durability and gain an advantage in one-on-one fights. Additionally, Trundle's E provides knockback and slow, which disrupts K'Sante's attacks and makes it difficult for him to engage. Furthermore, K'Sante has a short range, making him susceptible to Trundle's attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to actively manage minions from the early game and avoid short trades with Trundle. Using Q and dashes to deal small amounts of damage and timing attacks when Trundle's E is on cooldown can be effective. After level 6, it is crucial to be wary of Trundle's R and to ensure escape routes while fighting. Coordinating with allies' crowd control and aiming for an all-in when Trundle's pillar is down can create opportunities for a comeback.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle relies on auto-attacks and has strong abilities, especially against tanks. When Gangplank is disrupted by Trundle's E knockback and slow, he becomes unfavorable in trades. Additionally, Trundle has the ability to absorb AR/MR, making it easier for him to reduce Gangplank's damage in long trades. Furthermore, Trundle has limited mobility, making it difficult for Gangplank to create distance using his skills and allowing him to be kited easily.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to avoid contact with Trundle, use barrels for zoning, and focus on short trades. When Trundle approaches, countering with Q or barrels to chip away at his health can be effective. It is also crucial to prioritize farming and position yourself to avoid being pushed in by Trundle. In terms of rune selection, choosing Grasp or Fleet can enhance survivability and help alleviate the disadvantage in trades.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\nThe reason is that Trundle's R ability to steal stats, along with his E ability that provides knockback and slow, is very effective against Teemo. Since Teemo relies on auto-attacks, having his armor and magic resistance stolen by Trundle's R significantly reduces Teemo's damage output. Additionally, Trundle can gain an advantage over Teemo by getting close and landing auto-attacks, and Teemo's blind effect does not significantly impact Trundle's skills. Furthermore, Teemo has low base durability and is vulnerable to Trundle's sustained damage.\n\nTo mitigate this disadvantage, it is important to engage in small trades between levels 1 and 3, using E to manage minions while harassing with auto-attacks and Q. It is also crucial to place wards and mushrooms appropriately to secure vision and prevent Trundle's approach. After level 6, be mindful to create distance before Trundle activates his R, and by positioning to the side and using mushrooms to zone, you can avoid direct confrontations with Trundle. In terms of item selection, choosing AP-oriented items like Nashor's Tooth or Liandry's Anguish, and utilizing Flash and Ignite to secure an escape route can also be effective."

    "loses": {
      "ナー": "Gnar has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gnar has superiority over Trundle in the following aspects. First, Gnar can increase his damage by stacking his Q, and especially in mini form, he has high mobility, making it easier to avoid Trundle's attacks. Additionally, Gnar's W (Wither) reduces Trundle's attack speed, making it easier to counter Trundle's auto-attacks. Furthermore, Gnar has powerful CC (stun) in his Mega Gnar form due to his transformation, allowing him to create advantageous situations in team fights and 1v1s.\n\nTo take advantage, during the laning phase, focus on safely stacking your Q and avoid unnecessary skirmishes. Position yourself to avoid being separated by Trundle's E (Pillar), and it's important to use W to delay when Trundle attacks. In the mid-game, avoid risky 1v1s while using TP or Flash to safely join your team, and in team fights, maintain distance to prevent Trundle from using his R. In the late game, if you are well-farmed, you can side push, and in team fights, avoid getting too close to Trundle, saving W for key targets to neutralize Trundle's advantage.",
      "グウェン": "Gwen has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Gwen has percentage damage and true damage, which allows her to deal effective damage, especially against tanks. Trundle relies mainly on auto-attacks, so Gwen's percentage damage is very effective. Additionally, by using Gwen's R (Hallowed Mist), she can easily avoid Trundle's attacks, increasing her survivability in team fights. Furthermore, Gwen can use skills with slow effects to limit Trundle's movements, maintaining an advantage in close combat.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to farm safely in the lane and avoid Trundle's W (Chomp). Attempting short trades after Trundle uses his W makes it easier to deal damage. You can also bait out Trundle's Q before attacking to waste his skill. For item builds, choosing Nashor's Tooth and Shadowflame can increase damage and allow you to play favorably against Trundle. Bringing Ignite is also effective in suppressing Trundle's healing.",
      "マルファイト": "Malphite has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Malphite's R (Unstoppable Force) is extremely powerful against Trundle. By using his R, Malphite can strip Trundle of his defenses and instantly incapacitate the enemy. Additionally, Malphite has high physical defense, giving him strong durability against Trundle's AA (auto attacks). Furthermore, Malphite can harass from a distance with his Q (Seismic Shard) and leverage his passive shield to gain an advantage in short trades.\n\nTo take advantage, first, choose Conqueror over Sorcery as a pre-game preparation and play safely in the early game. From levels 1 to 5, harass Trundle with Q and use the passive shield to execute short combos. After level 6, it is crucial to use R in coordination with the jungle to quickly eliminate Trundle. Also, after Trundle's R (Subjugate), avoid prolonged fights and focus on short bursts of damage, as this is key to victory. By being mindful of E (Pillar) and dodging Trundle's attacks, you can maximize Malphite's strengths.",
      "ボリベア": "Braum is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Braum levels up quickly from the early game and has strong traits for ganks and short-term engagements. Against Trundle, Braum can limit the opponent's movement with his E's stun effect and deal damage instantly. Additionally, Braum's passive increases his attack speed, making it easier to deal continuous damage. Since Trundle relies on auto-attacks, he often cannot withstand Braum's high burst damage.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important to actively interfere in the lane from the early game and initiate ganks on Trundle. Aim for a stun with E between levels 1 and 3 to chip away at Trundle's HP and gain lane control. Furthermore, after level 6, using R to attempt tower dives can also be effective. By taking the initiative before Trundle uses his R, you can secure the fight before it turns into a long-term battle. Additionally, when it comes to securing objectives, leveraging Braum's high damage and tower dive capability to actively target dragons and Baron is advisable.",
      "レネクトン": "Renekton is at an advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Renekton has high sustain in the early lane and can use his short cooldown skills to trade effectively. Specifically, while Trundle's Q skill reduces AD, which lowers Renekton's attack power, Renekton can leverage his healing ability to sustain fights, making it easier for him to gain an advantage in trades. Additionally, Renekton's R skill increases his durability, enhancing his survivability in a 1v1 against Trundle.\n\nTo take advantage, Renekton should focus on short trades, using his E skill to close the gap and execute combos. If Trundle's R skill is on cooldown, Renekton can aggressively initiate attacks; conversely, if Trundle's R is active, it is effective to avoid forced 1v1s and continue with short trades. Furthermore, having items that reduce healing effects can suppress Trundle's healing, allowing Renekton to gain an even greater advantage.",
      "ランブル": "Rumble has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Rumble can harass from a distance early on and can deal damage to Trundle while escaping using his E. Additionally, Rumble's R provides sustained damage and slows to enemies within its range, making it easier to prevent Trundle from closing the gap. Since Trundle relies on melee attacks, effectively using Rumble's skills allows for an advantageous trade.\n\nTo gain the advantage, first, harass Trundle with E between levels 1 and 3 while managing heat carefully. It is important to avoid long trades considering Trundle's Q healing. In lane maintenance, do not push the minions too much, be aware of your jungler, and when Trundle engages, deal damage with E while securing an escape route.\n\nAfter level 6, use Rumble's R to zone and force positioning to avoid Trundle's R absorption of stats. When Trundle approaches using W (Pillar), it is crucial to create distance with R and split the enemies. During an all-in, save Flash to avoid being immobilized by Trundle's W, and either create distance according to the pillar or forcibly separate with R.\n\nIn this way, Rumble can maneuver advantageously against Trundle by utilizing his skills.",
      "ナサス": "Nasus has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Nasus has extremely high single-target damage and durability in the late game, and his damage scales infinitely by stacking with his Q. Trundle excels in early 1v1s, but Nasus is weak in the early game, so he can struggle when Trundle plays aggressively. However, Nasus has a powerful R after level 6, which allows him to secure an advantage in duels by stealing Trundle's defenses. Additionally, Nasus's W slow and attack speed reduction weaken Trundle's reliance on auto-attacks, contributing to Nasus's favorable position.\n\nTo take advantage, first, avoid unnecessary trades in the early game and prioritize farming with Q. If Trundle attacks, back off behind the minions and use W to prevent him from healing. Once you reach level 6, it’s important to not hold back your R and to create distance when Trundle uses his R, coordinating with your teammates to fight. In the mid to late game, you can utilize Nasus's strengths by stacking Q in the side lanes while securing vision and participating in team fights with your TP as needed.",
      "アーゴット": "Urgot has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Urgot can deal powerful damage in short trades and is good at whittling down Trundle's durability. Urgot can poke Trundle from a distance with his Q, and after utilizing his passive for a quick auto-attack, he can disengage immediately to avoid Trundle's counterattack. Additionally, Urgot has crowd control, making it easier to limit Trundle's movements, especially after catching him with E and then aiming to finish with R.\n\nTo take advantage, first, in the early game, poke Trundle with Q while using minions to maintain range and repeatedly engage in short trades. It’s important to time Trundle's W healing and not to engage recklessly, instead using E or slows to create distance. After level 6, check Trundle's R usage and aim to finish him off when he is low on health and has used R. Prioritize penetration and short-term damage in your build to maintain an advantage in trades against Trundle.",
      "セト": "Sett has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Sett has sustained HP recovery abilities and a powerful shield, allowing him to gain the upper hand in a brawl against Trundle. Sett's W shield can absorb Trundle's attacks while creating opportunities for counterattacks. Additionally, Sett's E can pull Trundle in and stun him, limiting Trundle's movement and increasing opportunities for attacks.\n\nTo take advantage, it is important for Sett to actively trade in lane, using his W to shield while absorbing Trundle's attacks and dealing damage with his Q. Furthermore, if Trundle attempts to knock him back with his E, Sett can use his E to catch Trundle and aim for a stun, allowing for favorable trades. In team fights, if Sett can utilize his R to pull Trundle in and coordinate with allies to deal damage, he can further enhance his advantage.",
      "ダリウス": "Darius has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Darius is strong in long trades and can deal sustained damage with his passive. If he gets his defenses stripped by Trundle's R, he may become disadvantaged, but Darius has short-term burst damage, making it easier for him to secure a kill before Trundle can activate his R. Additionally, Darius has an E that can pull Trundle in, allowing him to catch Trundle and force a brawl.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early lane phase, Darius should use Q to farm minions while applying pressure on Trundle with auto-attacks. After trading, he should use W and be careful not to run out of potions. Once he reaches level 6, he should use R to aim for a finish while positioning carefully to avoid Trundle's pillar. For items, choosing items like the Dominik's and Black Cleaver, and preparing health regeneration items early is crucial to enhance his sustained combat ability. In team fights, he should look to pick off enemies from the side and aim to secure kills with R followed by E. If he can take down Trundle before he activates his R, it will allow the fight to proceed in their favor.",
      "イラオイ": "Illaoi has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Illaoi has high base stats and healing abilities, and her attacks utilizing tentacles are particularly powerful. Trundle relies on auto-attacks, making it difficult for him to deal with Illaoi's sustained damage from her tentacles. Additionally, by landing Illaoi's E skill, \"Test of Spirit,\" she can pull Trundle in, deal damage, and apply a slow effect, making it easier to limit Trundle's movements. Furthermore, Illaoi has strong traits against tank-type champions, allowing her to effectively counter Trundle's ultimate, \"Subjugate,\" which absorbs his armor.\n\nTo gain the advantage, it is important to avoid trading with Trundle until level 3 and to be aware of the level difference. When reaching level 6, it is crucial to leverage the ultimate to overwhelm Trundle. In the early game, farm near the tower, using the E skill to chip away at Trundle's HP while maintaining distance. Additionally, freezing the wave to deny Trundle CS and waiting for him to run out of mana helps with resource management. By employing these strategies, Illaoi can maintain an advantageous position against Trundle.",
      "ヨネ": "Yone has the advantage.\n\nThe reason is that Yone possesses burst damage and high mobility, making him strong in short skirmishes. In particular, by using E (Spirit Cleave), he can safely engage and disengage, allowing him to attack while avoiding Trundle's strikes. Additionally, Yone can deal instant burst damage against Trundle's R (Subjugate), which steals his healing and defenses, enabling him to gain an advantage before the fight turns into a prolonged battle.\n\nTo take advantage, in the early game (levels 1-5), Yone should attack Trundle from a distance with Q while securing a position that is not buried by minions. Around level 6, he should be cautious of Trundle's all-in and maintain a safe return line with E, avoiding unnecessary extensions. After level 6, Yone can engage and disengage with E after Trundle uses R to steal defenses, aiming for a quick kill. As for items, it is important to quickly build AS/critical items (like PD/IE) and prepare healing reduction items to suppress Trundle's healing. In team fights, it is crucial to coordinate with nearby allies to avoid being crushed by Trundle's R, either by quickly taking him down or positioning oneself to avoid being separated."
