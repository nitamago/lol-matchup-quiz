This allows Singed to avoid Pantheon's attacks while being able to counterattack.\n- Although Singed lacks ranged attacks, which may make it seem temporarily advantageous for Pantheon when he gets close, Singed's sustained damage and crowd control (stuns and slows) make it difficult for Pantheon to approach.\n- Pantheon has long cooldowns on his skills, and in a prolonged fight against Singed, his DPS decreases. Since Singed excels in extended engagements, Pantheon finds himself at a disadvantage when he cannot deal sustained damage.\n- Singed has tank-like characteristics and can absorb Pantheon's attacks, diminishing the effectiveness of Pantheon's burst damage.",
      "シェン": "Shen is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Singed has a high ability to deal sustained damage, which can exceed Shen's shield, making Shen susceptible to damage.\n- Singed's poison deals continuous damage, which negates Shen's healing ability and reduces his durability in lane.\n- Singed has means of acceleration, making it difficult for Shen to approach, causing him to miss opportunities to engage.\n- Although Singed lacks ranged attack options, he can limit Shen's actions by spreading poison before Shen gets close.\n- Shen has limited AoE damage and few means to counter Singed's sustained damage, putting him at a disadvantage in prolonged fights.",
