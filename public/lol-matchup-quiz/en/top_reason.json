Here’s the translation of your text into English:\n\n-------------------------------------\nSinged has an advantage over Shen.\n\nThe reasons are as follows:\n\n- Singed has sustained damage that can easily penetrate Shen's shield. Since Shen lacks burst damage, he struggles to counter Singed's sustained damage.\n- Singed can spread poison along his path, hindering Shen's approach. This limits Shen's timing for engaging in attacks.\n- Singed has plenty of mobility options, making it easier to dodge Shen's skills. In particular, by avoiding Shen's taunt, Singed can move freely.\n- Singed has strong pushing power in the lane, which can prevent Shen from farming effectively. This makes it easier for Singed to create a CS gap.\n- Singed excels in prolonged fights and can continuously deal damage against Shen's defensive skills, making it difficult for Shen to create advantageous situations.\n-------------------------------------",

This allows Shen to be more susceptible to harassment in lane.\n- Shen is primarily a melee tank and struggles to counter Jayce's long range. Jayce can attack while maintaining distance, making it difficult for Shen to approach.\n- Jayce's burst damage is very high, allowing him to deal significant damage before Shen can use his shield. This reduces Shen's chances of winning in one-on-one situations.\n- Shen has low pushing power, so Jayce can push the lane, denying Shen farm and creating a favorable situation for himself.\n- Jayce can avoid Shen's skills, making it easier to dodge Shen's crowd control and maintain a favorable position when going for an all-in.",

      "トランドル": "Here is the translation of your text into English:\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nTrundle has an advantage over Shen.\n\nThe reasons are as follows:\n\n- Trundle can absorb Shen's armor, which increases his damage output in one-on-one situations, allowing him to gain an advantage over Shen.\n- Trundle's passive healing effect makes it easier for him to sustain in lane, allowing him to endure Shen's attacks more effectively.\n- Shen's skills are primarily defensive, and he has limited means to negate Trundle's attacks, making it easier for Trundle to deal sustained damage to Shen.\n- Trundle is less susceptible to Shen's crowd control (CC) and can continue to attack while avoiding Shen's strikes.\n- Shen has limited AoE damage, which works to Trundle's advantage when dealing single-target damage.\n\n-------------------------------------"
