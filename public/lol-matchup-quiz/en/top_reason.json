Renekton can unleash combos with short cooldowns, allowing him to gain an advantage in trades.\n- Renekton can disable Irelia with skills that have stun effects, preventing her from counterattacking. This creates a situation where Irelia cannot utilize her blink or sustain effectively.\n\nHow to take advantage:\n- Since Irelia cannot be beaten at level 1, avoid going for CS until level 2 and push the minions to prevent Irelia from stacking her passive.\n- Counterattack when Irelia misses her skills and initiate trades using empowered attacks. Particularly, after Irelia uses her skills is a good opportunity to attack.\n- After level 6, aim for an all-in, using Ignite early to hinder Irelia's healing, ensuring consistent damage output.",

      "トリンダメア": "Tryndamere has the advantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Tryndamere has high HP regeneration capabilities and excels in sustained combat, making it easy for him to recover even after taking damage from Irelia.\n- His ultimate allows him to become invulnerable for 5 seconds, negating Irelia's stuns and burst damage, giving him a high win rate in one-on-one situations.\n- Irelia is strong in the early game, but Tryndamere becomes powerful after level 6, gaining an advantage in the late game.\n\nHow to take advantage:\n- From levels 1 to 3, freeze the minions to prevent Irelia's Q resets while avoiding unnecessary trades.\n- Once you reach level 6, use your ultimate to charge at Irelia, forcing her to use her skills before attacking.\n- In team fights, target the backline from the side while avoiding Irelia's skills and dealing damage."

      "クイン": "Quinn is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle has high durability and healing, making him strong in prolonged fights, which makes Quinn's short-term attacks ineffective.\n- Trundle excels at using obstacles to chase and divide, which can significantly limit Quinn's mobility.\n- Even while taking damage from Quinn, Trundle can enhance his stats with his ultimate, reducing Quinn's damage, making direct confrontations unfavorable.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n\n- After pushing the lane, actively roam to increase influence by aiming for kills in other lanes.\n- Avoid direct confrontations with Trundle and harass from a safe position while maintaining vision.\n- Strengthen coordination with the jungle and look for opportunities to gank when Trundle is isolated.",
      "リヴェン": "Riven is at a disadvantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Trundle is strong in prolonged fights and has high lane sustain, making Riven's strategy of aiming for a quick finish less effective.\n- Trundle can reduce Riven's attack power with his skills, and especially after level 6, Riven's damage becomes less effective due to the loss of defense.\n- If Riven's engage is hindered by Trundle's pillar, Riven's mobility cannot be utilized, resulting in missed opportunities to attack.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Purchase a Bramble Vest as the first item to reduce Trundle's healing, improving sustained combat ability.\n- Use minions to block vision and time attacks to avoid Trundle's skills.\n- Aim for jungle intervention to create a numerical advantage against Trundle, making it easier for Riven to aim for a quick finish.",
      "ガレン": "Garen is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle is strong in prolonged fights and has high healing capabilities, making Garen's short-term tactics less effective.\n- When Garen's defenses are reduced by Trundle's ultimate, his durability decreases, and he loses his advantage in one-on-one encounters.\n- If Garen's approach is hindered by Trundle's Pillar, he cannot land attacks, putting him at a disadvantage in trades.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Purchase healing reduction items early to limit Trundle's healing.\n- Engage in short trades repeatedly, using minions to break line of sight while fighting.\n- Adjust positioning to avoid Trundle's Pillar and time the approach carefully.",
      "ヨリック": "Yorick is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle is strong in prolonged fights and head-on confrontations, especially because he can reduce Yorick's durability by using his ultimate, making him prone to losing in one-on-one situations.\n- Yorick relies on his pets, so if Trundle's pillar separates the pets' positions, his combat ability significantly decreases.\n- Trundle has high healing and sustain, making it easier for him to endure Yorick's attacks, which puts Yorick at a disadvantage in prolonged battles.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Purchase healing counter items early to suppress Trundle's sustain.\n- Use walls at the right timing to block Trundle's charges and pillars, and utilize Maiden to implement a split strategy.\n- Prioritize CS by focusing on minions and avoid unnecessary head-on fights to maintain lane advantage.",
      "ドクター・ムンド": "Dr. Mundo is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle has high duel performance for short-term engagements and can strip away Mundo's durability, often putting him at a disadvantage in one-on-one situations.\n- Trundle's pillar disrupts Mundo's movement and hinders his healing, making it difficult to drag the fight into a long-term battle.\n- Trundle can apply constant pressure on Mundo, who has limited mobility, by attacking or trading from a distance.\n\nMitigation strategies for the disadvantage:\n\n- In the early game, avoid unnecessary fights, poke from a distance with Q, and maintain the lane while securing minions.\n- Be mindful of positioning to avoid Trundle's pillars, and retreat to the backline when necessary to evade trades.\n- After level 6, utilize R to heal and drag the fight into a long-term engagement, enduring Trundle's attacks while waiting for support from allies.",
      "オーン": "Ornn is at a disadvantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Trundle has the ability to absorb Ornn's defenses, making it easier to gain an advantage in damage trades during one-on-one encounters.\n- Due to Trundle's healing capabilities, it becomes difficult for Ornn to sustain damage in prolonged fights, even if he deals short-term damage.\n- Trundle can easily restrict Ornn's movement with his E ability, making it hard for Ornn to escape since he lacks mobility options.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Build defensive items early to reduce Trundle's damage.\n- Avoid short trades and maneuver to prevent Trundle's healing by utilizing the minion wave.\n- Coordinate with the jungle to gank when Trundle is weak, avoiding his strong timings.",
      "サイオン": "Sion is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle can enhance his own abilities while stealing Sion's defensive stats, giving him a high win rate in one-on-one encounters.\n- Sion, who has limited mobility, is easily restricted by Trundle's E ability, making it difficult for him to avoid attacks.\n- Sion's skills have a slow activation time, making it hard to hit the highly mobile Trundle and deal sustained damage.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Maintain distance and poke early on, avoiding unnecessary brawls.\n- Build tankier items to increase durability and withstand Trundle's attacks.\n- In team fights, coordinate with allies to avoid isolating Sion from the team.",
      "ワーウィック": "Warwick is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle can absorb his own abilities and deal powerful damage, especially against tanks, giving him a high win rate in one-on-one situations.\n- Warwick lacks mobility, making it difficult to chase or escape due to Trundle's pillars.\n- Trundle's passive healing effect often surpasses Warwick's healing capabilities, leading to unfavorable trades in fights.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Purchase items early to enhance HP and attack speed, allowing for more favorable trades against Trundle.\n- Position carefully to avoid Trundle's pillars and time your approach effectively.\n- In team fights, coordinate with teammates to isolate Trundle, preventing him from leveraging his strengths.",
      "オラフ": "Olaf is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle can enhance his abilities by taking damage from Olaf and can steal Olaf's armor, giving him a significant advantage in one-on-one encounters.\n- Thanks to Trundle's passive, he can heal by killing nearby enemy units, making him good at maintaining the lane and likely able to withstand Olaf's attacks.\n- Olaf has limited mobility options and can easily be restricted by Trundle's slows and knockbacks, putting him in a very unfavorable situation if he gets kited.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n\n- By positioning cleverly at level 1, you can force Trundle to use his initial attack on minions, allowing you to trade more favorably.\n- With the help of the jungler, you can engage Trundle in a group attack, leveraging Olaf's strengths.\n- Focus on farming safely under the tower, prioritizing survival over risky all-ins, and aim to contribute in team fights and skirmishes.",
      "フィオラ": "Fiora is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle is strong in prolonged fights and has high healing capabilities, making it easier for him to withstand Fiora's burst damage.\n- Trundle's pillar restricts Fiora's movement, making it difficult for her to engage and causing her to miss opportunities to attack.\n- Trundle has few means to block Fiora's attacks, especially when his ultimate is used, making him susceptible to damage.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Position strategically to avoid Trundle's pillar and attack while maintaining distance.\n- Parry Trundle's skills to prevent damage and create opportunities for counterattacks.\n- Receive jungle support to initiate short skirmishes against Trundle, gaining an advantage.",

      "カ・サンテ": "K'Sante is at a disadvantage.\n\nReasons:\n- Trundle relies on auto-attacks and has the ability to negate K'Sante's shields and crowd control, making K'Sante's defensive measures less effective.\n- Trundle's ultimate reduces K'Sante's durability, causing him to lose his advantage in one-on-one situations.\n- Trundle can use his pillar to restrict K'Sante's movement, limiting his options to engage or escape, making fights unfavorable.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n- Attack when Trundle's pillar is on cooldown to deal burst damage.\n- Purchase items early to increase durability and reduce Trundle's damage.\n- Coordinate with the ally jungler or support to initiate team fights against Trundle and create advantageous situations.",
      "ガングプランク": "Gangplank is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle relies on auto-attacks, making him susceptible to damage from Gangplank's attacks. Especially since Trundle can enhance his stats with his abilities while fighting, he becomes disadvantaged in one-on-one encounters.\n- Trundle has limited mobility options, allowing Gangplank to harass while maintaining distance, but once Trundle closes the gap, his strengths diminish. If Gangplank is restricted by Trundle's slows or knockbacks, it becomes difficult for him to retaliate.\n- Trundle has high tankiness, making it easier for him to mitigate Gangplank's damage. Particularly, Trundle's ultimate increases his durability, giving him an advantage in team fights and objective contests.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n\n- Avoid contact with Trundle and use barrels for zoning while focusing on short trades. This reduces the risk of taking auto-attack damage from Trundle.\n- Prioritize farming and maneuver to avoid being pushed in by Trundle. Specifically, maintain lane control and seek assistance from the jungler when necessary.\n- Adjust runes by selecting Grasp or Fleet to enhance survivability during trades. This makes it easier to maintain durability even when engaging with Trundle.",
      "ティーモ": "Teemo is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Trundle has the ability to enhance his own attack power and negate Teemo's attacks, making one-on-one fights difficult.\n- Trundle's healing ability makes it hard for Teemo's harassment to be effective, making it challenging to deal sustained damage.\n- Trundle can use his pillar to close the gap on Teemo, who has limited mobility, making it difficult for Teemo to escape.\n\nWays to mitigate the disadvantage:\n\n- Between levels 1 and 3, play carefully to utilize Teemo's harassment while avoiding Trundle's attacks.\n- Use wards and mushrooms to secure vision and farm safely while keeping track of Trundle's movements.\n- Be mindful to create distance before Trundle uses his ultimate, and coordinate with teammates to deal damage in team fights."
