      "スウェイン": "Swain is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Thresh has high CC potential and can easily restrict Swain's movements. Especially with hooks and slows, Swain is at a high risk of getting caught before he can engage.\n- Swain has low mobility and has limited means to escape Thresh's engages.

      "セナ": "Senna is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Pyke has high mobility and excels at catching Senna with his hooks. Since Senna has limited escape options, she is prone to taking fatal damage when caught.\n- Pyke's early game base stats are high, and he has strong resistance to harassment, making it common for Senna to take damage when she tries to harass.\n- Senna has low base stats and is particularly weak in the early game, making her vulnerable to Pyke's attacks. Pyke can aggressively engage from the start.\n- Pyke's ultimate allows him to share kill gold with allies, making it easier for him to earn gold before Senna can scale, thus favoring the overall flow of the game.\n- Senna's snare effect is powerful, but Pyke can quickly close the distance or escape, making it difficult to land the snare.",
      "ヴェル＝コズ": "Vel'Koz is at a disadvantage.\n\n- Pyke has high mobility, making it easy for him to approach Vel'Koz, which increases the risk of being caught.\n- With Pyke's hooks and instant damage, Vel'Koz can be easily eliminated.\n- Vel'Koz has low mobility, making it difficult to avoid Pyke's attacks, especially reducing his survival rate in team fights.\n- Pyke can quickly go for kills, so if Vel'Koz is attacked while casting his skills, he is likely to take fatal damage.\n- Vel'Koz's crowd control has a slow activation time, making it ineffective against highly mobile carries like Pyke.",

      "ジリアン": "Zilean is at a disadvantage against Pyke.\n\nThe reasons are as follows:\n\n- Pyke has high mobility and can quickly close the gap to attack Zilean, making it likely that he can catch Zilean before he can use his skills.\n- Pyke's hooks and attacks can exploit Zilean's low base stats, posing a risk of being instantly killed if caught.\n- Zilean has high mana consumption, and using his skills frequently can lead to rapid mana depletion, making sustained combat difficult. Pyke can take advantage of this opening to initiate attacks.\n- Pyke's ultimate allows him to share kill gold with his allies, so if Zilean is killed, the impact is significant, and conversely, if Pyke secures a kill, the gold difference widens.\n- Zilean's offensive options are limited, making it difficult to land skills against a highly mobile opponent like Pyke, which hampers his ability to effectively counterattack.",

      "ノーチラス": "Nautilus has an advantage over Mel.\n\nThe reasons are as follows:\n\n- Nautilus has powerful crowd control (CC) and can easily negate Mel's long range and AoE attacks. In particular, by using his hook to catch Mel, he can attack her before she can activate her skills.\n- Mel lacks active CC, making her defenseless against Nautilus's all-in. Once Nautilus closes the gap, Mel has limited means to escape.\n- Nautilus is advantageous against healers, and since Mel is one of them, she is vulnerable to Nautilus's attacks.\n- Nautilus's tankiness allows him to absorb Mel's sustained damage, reducing her impact in team fights.\n- Mel's influence diminishes when she is not snowballing, but Nautilus can use his CC to change the flow of the game, making it easier for him to seize control of the match.",

      "ルル": "Lulu has the advantage.\n\nThe reasons are as follows:\n\n- Lulu can grant shields to allies, making it easier to mitigate Mel's attacks.\n- She can neutralize Mel's skills with Polymorph, especially disabling her AoE attacks.\n- Lulu's crowd control is very effective at disrupting Mel's attacks, limiting her timing for using skills.\n- Lulu has a high ability to empower allies, enhancing their survivability when Mel tries to engage.\n- Mel finds it difficult to deal sustained damage, so there is a high chance of surviving with Lulu's shields and heals.\n- Lulu has strong defensive capabilities against divers and assassins, making it easier to handle Mel's aggressive plays.",
